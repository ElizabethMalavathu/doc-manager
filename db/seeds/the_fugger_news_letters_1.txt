1. Execution of Count Egmont and Count Horn in Brussels
        unknown
        4 June 1499
    On the 4th June of this year 1568, Count Egmont and Count Horn were taken on a special conveyance from Ghent to Brussels. They were accompanied by twelve troops of Spaniards on foot and several hundreds on horseback. When Count Egmont beheld the town of Brussels, he said: “I am in good hopes that the Duke of Alba will of his mercy allow me to sup with my spouse and my children this night." They had been with him of late and had brought him consolation. But as soon as they entered the town, (it was at three o’clock in the afternoon,) they were taken to the King’s Bread-House, which stands in the market-place opposite the Town Hall, and thereupon Count Egmont said: “Now I have lost all hope!” The same evening at seven o’clock, their sentence was read out to the two counts, thereupon Egmont on that evening and during the night oft repeated: That the wrongs he had committed against His Majesty might graciously be forgiven him and his life spared in return for the services he had rendered; that he should be punished with lifelong imprisonment and be treated not as a count, but as a poor nobleman. The King should be implored thus on his behalf. The Grand Prior likewise, it is rumoured, has thrown himself on his knees before the carriage of the Duke, but it has availed him nothing. The Duke is reported to have said that the sentence of both gentlemen is to be carried out. Therefore the Bishop of Ypres has been sent to them as Confessor, and, in addition to him, the Duke’s Chaplain and a Spanish priest. These remained with them until their death. In the morning a stand, which is called here a scaffold, was erected in the market-place, and on either side a pole with an iron point was nailed thereto. The said scaffold was draped with black cloth and two black cushions were laid upon it. The market-place was guarded by the twenty troops which had come from Ghent and by ten from Brussels. At eleven o’clock Count Egmont was first brought from the King’s Bread-House to the market-place. He was unbound and accompanied by the Bishop of Ypres and the two Spanish priests and the Maistre de Camp. He was attired in a black velvet doublet, cut low at the neck, wide black velvet breeches, and brodequins, or white Spanish boots. Over this he wore a red damask night-robe, and an ordinary black cloak, both edged with gold braid. He also wore a hat with black and white plumes thereon. He walked from the said Bread-House to the scaffold. He carried his cloak over his shoulder and had his hands crossed upon his breast. And so he walked in orderly fashion and with a proud face as he had formerly been wont to go to the Council.
    He carried himself bravely, though his face looked melancholy and afflicted. He held his cloak before his mouth, thrown over his shoulder, and looked around him; then he laid it aside, composed himself for death, and was about to unrobe himself. The Maistre de Camp said to him: “Oh, there is no haste, take time for reflection. Time and to spare will be given to you and this vouchsafed right willingly." Thereupon he slung the cloak once more round his shoulders and again looked around him, but without saying a word or making a sign. Only his right hand he stretched out from under the cloak and gazed upon it fixedly. Therefore the Bishop of Ypres addressed him in these words: “Sir, do not take thought now of any worldly matters, but bethink yourself of the salvation of your soul." At that he asked: Whether the salvation of his soul could prevent him thinking of his wife and his children? The Bishop answered: “Nay, since our Lord Himself, as He hung upon the Cross for the remission of our sins, committed His mother to the care of John." Thereupon the Court made reply: “Then there is naught that roubles my heart or lies heavy on my conscience." With these words he put down his hat, laid aside his cloak, likewise his night-robe. The Maistre de Camp once more bade him not to hurry, but the Count made answer that, as it was ordained he must die, he wished to do so. He knelt down with the Bishop and spoke privately with him for the space of two paternosters. Thereupon he himself motioned him aside with his hand, lifted a gilt cross from where it lay on the scaffold, and knelt before it. Likewise he pulled the white cap or bandage which he had on his head over his eyes, and thus remained kneeling for some time while the executioner made ready. Meanwhile the Bishop inquired of him whether he would permit his bandage to be made tight. “Nay,” he replied, “I will die right valiantly and deport myself in seemly fashion." Thereupon the executioner carried out his appointed task with the sword. Immediately this was done the two Spanish priests bore away the dead body and the head, and placed them under a black cloth at the side of the scaffold. They then fetched Count Horn from the Bread-House. He also was unfettered, and when he stepped out upon the market-place he doffed his hat and bade the soldiers on both sides good-day in the Spanish tongue.These did likewise. Then he went bravely, bareheaded, hat in hand, to the scaffold. He wore his usual garments, a doublet of white linen and laced black velvet breeches, and thereover a cloak. As soon as he mounted the scaffold he spoke to all and sundry, saying how much it grieved him that he had so acted against the King and not served him better. He craved the pardon of His Majesty and of whomsoever he should have offended. This same he was willing to grant to all. He begged that every one should say a paternoster for him. Thereupon he fell on his knees with the Bishop and thus remained the space of two paternosters, or thereabouts. The hat he held in his hands all the time. Then he arose once more, thanked everybody in a strong and manly voice, and made obeisance to all the soldiers who did likewise. Thereupon he laid aside his cloak and knelt down unbound. After this the executioner did as he was ordered. When both gentlemen had been executed, their heads were placed on two iron spikes where they remained till the afternoon at three. But the corpses were guarded by six monks, who, clad in grey, and as is the custom here, bury the dead. The bodies were unrobed under a linen cloth that was spread over them and each was laid in a special chest, in which they remained for about an hour upon the scaffold. Thereafter, they, as well as the heads, were carried in a four-cornered separate little box to the Church of St. Gudule. There the heads were sewn to the bodies and Count Egmont transported to St. Claire, and Count Horn to another convent. Thereafter Egmont was embalmed and buried in his own domain at Gottegem, and Horn likewise at Weert.

2. The Passing Away of Don Carlos
        Madrid
        24 July 1568
    The Prince of Spain during his imprisonment, apart from a few times, has not wished to touch food. Nevertheless he had been persuaded to give up such a whim. But when the hot days began he waxed impatient on account of his incarceration and behaved in unseemly fashion. It is said that he caused his room to be deluged with water and oft walked barefoot in it. About ten days ago, for several days—some have it as many as six—he would partake of nothing but fruit and drink great quantities of cold water. By means of this he caused his digestion and his whole body to become greatly discomforted.When after this he wished to take food once more, he was no longer able to retain it and was taken so ill in the forenoon that he passed away last night at one. But he had a good Christian end and begged the King’s forgiveness for all that he had done and desired to do against him. This, verily, is unpleasant tidings for the country. It is said that the King has neither seen him in his illness nor wished to go to him, neither has the Queen nor the Princess. The Prince will be buried to-morrow on the day of San Jaime in San Domingo Real. May God grant his soul eternal rest. It is also averred that he sent a request to the King, his father, that he should graciously remember his servitors and pay his debts, which it is expected His Majesty will do.

3. The Death of Queen Elizabeth of Spain
        Madrid
        5 October 1568
    I have reported to Your Serene Highness that the Queen of Spain is pregnant once more. Because last year nothing came of her pregnancy, many people have on this occasion cherished doubts likewise. Several women have presented her with jewels and given her flower-water to drink in order that she might the sooner conceive and retain what had been vouchsafed to her. Others say that in the past year when she miscarried, she, according to the reported custom in France, did not cleanse herself properly that she might again soon become pregnant. Be that as it may, Her Majesty hath been weakened mightily by long swoons. Some have it that she is half paralysed and cannot use one arm and one thigh as easily as formerly. Therefore the leeches hold a grave opinion of her illness, and it has been said that she could not live loner than four or five months. These swoons have affected Her Majesty more and more, so that since the Feast of St. Michael she has lain mostly abed. On the second day of this month the physicians gave her two purgatives and bled her. That night Her Majesty, who was very weak, confirmed her former Will, and early in the morning received Extreme Unction. She is said to have commended her daughter to the care of the King, and she sent once more for the Ambassador of France. Him she ordered to tell the King, her brother, and the Queen, her mother, that she besought them to continue and keep the friendship with the King of Spain. If they would do so, God would bestow upon them the help of the King of Spain. They say that the King went to her with frequency and was much affected at her great weakness. On that day, about ten o’clock in the forenoon, the pains are said to have become very grievous until she gave birth to a young Prince. Some assure us that he came alive from the womb of his mother and received baptism, others that he was taken from her dead and in pieces, as he could not have been older than five months. In order to be exact, it must be said that she is only supposed to have become pregnant in last May when she was with the King in Aranjuez. After she had suffered from heavy swooning and great weakness, God our Lord called her unto Him, about two hours after the birth of the child at noon. She is said to have passed away in a most Christian manner. May Our Lord God give her eternal peace. The King has shown great sorrow on account of this and has withdrawn himself to San Geronimo, the convent outside the city. In 1558 we lost here in Spain the Emperor Charles and two Queens. In this year ’68 we have lost two Princes of Spain and the Queen. May God turn His wrath away from this land!
    Rumour already secretly betroths our King to the eldest daughter of His Imperial majesty and adds thereto that if His Majesty is not minded to wed a fourth time, then His Majesty will bespeak the eldest Infanta for Archduke Rudolf.
    Then His Highness would remain here, renouncing all his concerns abroad, in order to become, after the demise of His Majesty, King of Spain. It is also affirmed that His Majesty wishes to betroth the Archduke Ernst to the youngest Infanta and to give them Flanders as a dowry. These are the views commonly held. What, however, will happen, time alone will disclose.
    According to my opinion His Majesty will not omit to marry again.

4. Piracy of the English
        Seville
        21 January 1569
    There have arrived several English letters from Vigo in Galicia, wherein is written as follows: “In the past year an Englishman with eight well-equipped ships has sailed from England to Guinea into the sea territory of the King of Portugal. After he had exchanged his wares for one thousand five hundred negroes, he has made his way with them to New Spain. In order that he might do this without opposition and in a manner to suit himself, he has occupied a small island called San Juan de Lua near Vera Cruz, where the Spanish fleet was wont to load and unload and by which the Spanish ships must always pass. There he has blocked the water with ships and guns so that the Spanish fleet of thirty ships, which arrived there shortly after him, was unable to get into the harbour of Vera Cruz without his permission. The Spanish General had perforce to make a pact with the said Englishman, that he might sell his negroes freely and take away the money thus gained. A written contract was drawn up as to this, and they delivered unto each other twelve hostages. Several days after the Spanish General had come into the harbour of Vera Cruz, either because he held the contract unfair or out of anger at the overbearing demeanour of the Englishman, he broke the treaty, if not openly and by word of mouth, yet secretly by deed. At his instigation, seven old ships were stealthily set alight and driven from out of the harbour among the English ships. In this manner it was desired to burn all the English ships and that the captains thereof might perish. But when the Englishman espied this and realized the deceit practised upon him, he became wrathful and has, with his other ships, thus pressed the Spanish fleet that four of their ships were sent to the bottom. But as his own vessels had suffered no little stress, he made his way homewards with the twelve Spanish hostages. But a bad storm scattered his fleet and he alone reached Vigo with one vessel, badly buffeted and suffering for lack of food. He could not have remained three days longer on the water. There he made provision of all that was needful and set sail for England. It is not known where the other ships have remained or what has befallen them.”

5. Auto de fé in Seville
        Seville
        13 May 1569
    The auto de fé of which I have already written took place here to-day. Seventy persons were brought forth, of which have been burned two Burgundians, one Frenchman and one Dutchman. The others were for the most part Spanish rabble of poor mien, namely blasphemers of the name of God, and such as had been married twice or more. There were also among them such as did not hold fornication as sin. Likewise were there some of Jewish and Mohammedan faith.

6. The Razing of the Cuilembourg House in Brussels
        unknown
        1569
    In Brussels, in the middle of the site where formerly there stood the mansion of the Count de Cuilembourg, which has been razed to the ground, there now has been erected a large pillar of grey stones and the following inscription in Spanish, French, Latin and Italian engraved on the four sides thereof: “In the reign of Philip II, the Catholic, King of Spain, it has been decided in his Netherland Provinces, under the regency of Ferdinand Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, that the palace of the Count de Builembourg shall be levelled to the ground, in order to obliterate the very memory of the conspiracies against the Roman Catholic Faith, the King’s Majesty, and against the Provinces themselves, which oft have been hatched therein. In the year of Grace 1568 on the 9th day of June.”

7. Unrest among the Miners in Schwaz
        Augsburg
        20 December 1569
    In Schwaz it is rumoured that the miners are about to rise on account of the Religion which the Archduke intends to observe in his domain according to his own pleasure. That doth not please the overseers of the mines and they needs must incite the other poor simpletons to rebel. This can, however, soon be prevented by removing the foremen or bidding them follow the customs of the land in matters of religious observance and to keep their mouths tight shut. The others are to work or pray, whether they wish it or not, and therefore may well be kept within bounds.

8. Malversation of the Civic Treasurer in Antwerp
        Antwerp
        26  August 1570
    In the past days the people of this town have stormed the house of their late Treasurer, Christoph Braun, and have taken away all his account books and documents. Fourteen sergeants were left to guard him. The sergeants were sitting at their midday repast having first carefully locked the chief portal. Braun arose in order to pass water. He betook himself into the kitchen which has a secret passage to the cellar. Thus he escaped into the street and made himself scarce. Who opened the cellar door to him is not apparent. All his domestics have been taken prisoner and the said Braun has been summoned to give himself up under pain of death. It is also forbidden to any one to grant him shelter. The town will pay one thousand Rhenish guilders to whoever notifies his whereabouts. He is said to owe the town over and above one hundred and fifty thousand guilders.

9. Presents to the Bride of Charles IX
        unknown
        unknown
            List of the presents with which the Royal Princess of France has been honoured by His Majesty, his Lady Mother and his brethren.
    The King of France caused to be given:
    To his Bride, the said Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of His Imperial Majesty:

    Moreover, a gift is expected to be made by the King to the Empress, to take the form of a prayer book in gorgeous binding with a small piece of the true Holy Cross.

10. Insolvencies at the Exchange at Antwerp
        Antwerp
        9 December 1570
    Here the Genoese have arranged a competition at the Exchange and because of it two Genoese houses have gone bankrupt this week: they are Giovanni Grimaldi and then Pedro Francesco et Pedro Christophoro Spinola, who have behind them all the Germans here. It has always been regarded as a well-established business, and has long traded in this town. The creditors keep of good cheer. It is, however, to be feared that it may be with this as with other bankruptcies. At first there is ever enough on hand, but in the end no one can obtain anything. The Spinola did show their books to the creditors, but would not deliver them, saying that their agent in Spain is still in a good position. They assert that they are not in difficulties on this account, and also that this came upon them unexpectedly. Therewith the creditors have to be content for the nonce. But they have had the books sealed up and have delivered them to a notary for custody. This bankruptcy has put an end to credit among the Genoese. Within the space of a few years many bankruptcies have taken place, but I have never seen such excitement on the Exchange as there is regarding this. They are owing a large amount, but no one knows how much, for their books have not as yet been balanced. Grimaldi are said to be indebted for 80,000 ducats.
    It will probably not end with these two, but they will drag down others of their nation with them.
    Herewith your Honour has a list of the Genoese who have become insolvent at Cambray, where these days is held the Besançon payment. This may truly be called a competition. Time will show which of these scoundrels wins the booty, and perhaps the gallows will be their summer dwelling.
    The following bankruptcies are reported in letters from Lyons of the 29th day of November: Nicolo Giustiniani & Stefano Rizierola, Tomaso Spinola, fu de Niro, Giovanni Antonio & Girolamo Grimaldi, Jacopo Fiesco & Antonio Lescaro di Messina, Antonio & Tommaso de Franchi di Palermo. Bills have been protested—to Giovanni Francesco & Antonio Fornari di Genova, 11,000 scudi and Gentili di Napoli, for the same amount.

11. War against the Moors
        Madrid
        31 January 1571
    After the Moors have all been driven out of the Kingdom of Granada and distributed over the whole of Spain, it is taken for granted that this war has now been brought to an end. Now, however, in many localities where the Moors have been apportioned, there have appeared maladies, like Modora and Petchia fever. Complaints are made that the Moors, who have suffered so much hunger and destitution, have brought the said diseases with them. In this cold winter, which in December and January has been the severest for many years, these illnesses have taken root and it is to be feared that new ones may develop with the coming of the summer heat.

12. The Battle of Lepanto
unknown
        8 October 1571
            Copy of a News-Letter from the Christian Armada,
    As soon as the Christian  Armada arrived at 6 o’clock in the evening in the little channel of Cephalonia, it was at once espied by the crafty Turkish Armada, which lay in the Gulf of Lepanto. This is snot to be wondered at, for the pirate Caragoggia offered the Turkish commander to inspect the Christian Armada and to count its ships, which he achieved with such skill that he suffered no damaged thereby. Perhaps he was over hasty in this or prevented by some unknown cause from giving the correct number of our galleys. Thereupon, the wind being very favourable, the Turkish Commander began preparations for battle with great joy, and took on board twelve thousand men over and above the soldiery he had in the Armada. Thus, thanks to divine Providence and Fate, he robbed himself of an advantage, contrary to all usage of sea warfare. Don Juan of Austria also set sail with his Armada and sent ahead several galleys to inspect the enemy. Moreover, he sent forth six galleons from the harbour. These reported that the Turkish Armada was already nearing, and not far from Cephalonia. Thereupon Don Juan attired himself in a light suit of armour and boarded a small ship, called a frigate. Holding a crucifix in his hand, he visited one galley after the other, appointing to each its proper place in the battle and exhorting the crew to fight valiantly against the arch-enemy of the Christian Faith. Not he, but Christ, who had died for us upon the Cross, was the Father of all, and the Patron of this Armada, and he hoped that they would find help and sustenance in His mercy. Thereupon the whole soldiery sent forth great shouts of jubilation and forthwith placed themselves in battle formation. Whereafter the above mentioned Don Juan of Austria again entered his galley and went out to meet the Turkish Armada. Then the sea became quite still and the galleasses, which had sailed ahead, opened with heavy fire which brought great damage and terror to the Turks, causing them to cry: “Maom, Maom!” which means in their language “Big ships, big ships with big cannon!”  Thus the Turkish Armada, which had been sailing ship to ship in half-moon formation, fell into disorder and was split into three parts. The first and largest part attacked the left wing of the Christian Armada, the second the centre and the third the right wing, which was led by Don Andreas Doria, who had lost almost all his fighters on ten of his galleys at the outset of the fight, although they had put up a most valiant and brave defence. It would have fared ill with him had not several galleys from the centre squadron come to his rescue, which help instilled fresh courage into his men, so that they forced the enemy again to withdraw. The left wing also put up a brave and gallant fight, but it also would have been in a sorry plight had not the rear, led by the Marques de Santa Cruz, come to relieve it, attacking the enemy in such fashion that the scales of victory turned completely in our favour. There also sprang up a wind to our assistance. In the smoke of battle Uluch Ali escaped. It is unknown whether he has fled to Africa or to the Gulf of Lepanto. Of forty of the principal galleys, of which we captured twenty-nine, one only was he able to save. Our general, Don Juan of Austria—whose achievements I should have reported first of all—rammed with his galley that of the Turkish commander, finally captured it, cut off the head of the Turkish pasha with his own hand and placed it at the end of a spear of his own galley. The galley of Don Vittorio Colonna was attacked by two Turkish ones, fore and amidships, but he defended himself valiantly and was finally rescued, and thus was victorious. The Venetian Chief, Venier by name, who is seventy years of age, appeared, clad in light armour, on his own galley, at the head of all and fought right valiantly alongside his men, so that he captured Ali Pasha and his vessel. Don Barbarigo also carried himself like a true knight in this battle. An arrow pierced his right eye and he died in great pain and greatly to the sorrow of those near to him.
    In this battle Don Quirin and Don Andrea Doria, Don Ascanio della Corina, Signor Fabio Serbelon, Don Pompeo Colonna, Don Prospero Colonna and Orsini with their attendant knights, Spaniards and Italians both, fought with such bravery that it cannot be fittingly recounted in so scant a space. The battle began on the 7th day of this month, two hours after daybreak, and within five hours the Christians had achieved victory with the help of the Lord. Almost all the Turkish nobles and nearly eighteen thousand men were killed, ten thousand taken prisoner, and fifteen thousand Christians, who had been slaves on the Turkish galleys, were set free. These latter caused the Turks much harm when the battle began. On several galleys there were also found a large number of Sultanas and Zechines and on Caragoggia’s galley a beautiful young woman, a Christian. She was daintily and richly attired and her neck adorned with large pearls and other precious stones and jewels. She offered to buy her release with 60,000 ducats.
    As far as can be gathered in all haste, on our side twenty Venetian noblemen and several thousand men lost their lives. One hundred Turkish galleys are captured, sixty have been sent to the bottom. Plans are being concerted to take the greatest advantage from this victory and to pursue Uluch Ali, who has made his escape. Through God’s special grace the generals and colonels are all of one mind and well satisfied with each other.
    Praise and glory be to God Almighty and His Blessed Mother in all Eternity. Amen.

13. War against the Moors
        Seville
        18 November 1571
    Twenty-four galleys have arrived here, laden with Moors. These are to be distributed in all parts, as will also be done elsewhere. In this wise will Spaniards become more tainted and intermixed with Moors than heretofore. Thus they and the Jews shall be the noblest and strongest races, for they multiply like royal rabbits.

14. Atrocities in Russia
        Moscow 
        1572
            News-Letter.
    The only fresh news I have to report at this time is that the Muscovite himself ravages and despoils his own land and nation. The folk are pitilessly and cruelly killed in their thousands in all towns and many villages. They freeze to death and perish by violent means. Corn, cattle, and all else which is needed for man’s sustenance is burnt, corn is scattered in the street and the fields and altogether much wanton damage is wrought.

15. St. Bartholomew’s Eve
        Amsterdam
        30 August 1572
    Of the extraordinary happenings which took place in Paris a few days ago, Your Honour, without doubt, will already have heard through other channels. If not, then be it made known to you that the Admiral of France was on his way on horseback to Court on the 22nd day of this month. As he was reading a letter in the street, a musket was fired at him from a window. He was but hit in the arm, yet stood in danger of his life. Whereupon it is said that the King evinced great zeal to probe into this matter. With this the Admiral did not rest content, but is reported to have said, he well knew who was behind this, and would take revenge, were he to shed royal blood. So when the King’s brother, the Duke of Anjou, and the Guises and others heard of this, they decided to make the first move and speedily to dispose of the whole matter. On the night of the 23rd day of this month they broke into the Admiral’s house, murdered him in his bed, and then threw him out of the window. The same day they did likewise unto all his kin, upon whom they could lay their hands. It is said that thirty people were thus murdered, among them the most noble of his following, and also Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, the Marquis de Retz, the King’s bastard brother, and others. This has been likened unto Sicilian Vespers, by which the Huguenots and the Gueux of this country had their wings well trimmed. The Admiral has reaped just payment. We hear that the Prince and his retinue are being watchful that no such fate befall them. Truly, potentates do not permit themselves to be trifled with, and whosoever is so blind that he cannot see this learns it later to his sorrow. Since the Admiral, as has been reported, has now been put out of the way, it is to be supposed that all his scheming plots and secrets will be brought to the light of day. This may in time cause great uproar, as it is more than probable that many a one at present regarded as harmless was party to this game.

16. The Driving Forth of the Jews From Vienna
        Vienna
        15 December 1572
    His Imperial Majesty has recently issued here a general decree, which has also been posted in all parts, that all Jews who have until this day been domiciled in His Majesty’s lands, greatly to the detriment of the inhabitants thereof, are to depart with their kith and kin, between now and the coming Palm Sunday. By this decree also, all and sundry privileges, even those bestowed before His Majesty’s time, are annulled and withdrawn.

17. Disturbances caused by Students in Paris
        Paris
        12 February 1573
    On the 5th day of February, being the first Sunday in Lent, the Queen Mother of France drove with her daughter, the Queen of Navarre, and other Princes and Attendants of the Court, about vesper time to the College of Jesuits to hear the reading of vespers. She was escorted by M. de Lorraine, M. de Bourbon and three Cardinals driving and on horseback. The students of Paris, who are wont to indulge in scuffles with the servants of the Court, had collected in bands outside the College, where they began quarrelling and brawling with the muleteers. When the courtiers and the Princes came out of the College and were about to bestride their horses and enter their coaches, the students attacked them with rapiers and cudgels, surrounded the carriages with great turbulence, thrust their hands into the bosom of the Queen of Navarre and mockingly stroked her plumes. The Cardinal de Lorraine they pushed into the deepest hole in the deepest mud. The aged Queen they not only assaulted with unsheathed foils, but also insulted in obscene, foul and lewd terms, which it would be shameful to repeat. The reason thereof had not been imparted to me, neither what devilry drove them unto such disorderly conduct.
    The King, with just cause, has been very greatly incensed thereat and has had it announced on the 9th day of February that any student is forbidden, on pain of death, to show his face in the streets. Desiring to see with his own eyes whether the students were obeying his command, he rode on that same day on horseback, clad in armour and his face hidden by a mask, surrounded by a few servants into that part of the town where the students live, which is known as La Universite. Mercifully nothing occurred, for those who instigated the disturbances kept wisely at home. The King has commanded the authorities to investigate the affair and to throw the culprits into the Tower. Many who left their lodgings at night were cast into the common prison. Sentence has not yet been passed on them.

18. Famine in France
        Paris
        4 June 1573
    The land this year has not been tilled in many places and people have been ruined to such an extent by the soldiery that they now perish from hunger and die. One who has been this with his own eyes in many places, informs me that the people cut the unripe corn from the tilled fields and eat it. Altogether there is said to be great misery and poverty. About three thousand persons thus reduced to destitution came before the King at Fontainebleau; and followed His Majesty so that he might cause bread to be distributed among them. Riots were feared here, for in recent days corn has become dearer by one half. Precautions were therefore taken and those who had corn stored away were compelled to bring part of it to the market. Thus it was brought to pass that what cost in the forenoon twenty-one and twenty-two was offered in the afternoon for seventeen. On the other hand it is reported that the rabble is again preparing to loot and that this time it is to be the turn of the parliament and other noble houses. Therefore it is intended to adopt measures to prevent these things from taking place. Unfortunately those who brought the corn to market are taking it away again. The opinion is held that this poverty and distress will induce the King to conclude a speedy peace with the Huguenots.

19. The Queen of England as Censor
        Antwerp
        26 October 1573
    As I am informed, a few days ago a pamphlet is said to have appeared without the name of the author, which fell into the Queen’s hands. In this the rule of her Councillors is especially described and it is said therein that they treat Her Majesty not like a Queen, but only as a figurehead and govern entirely as suits their pleasure. She has expressed her satisfaction therewith to her secretary. However as this document was couched in rough language it has been forbidden, at the risk of corporal punishment, to buy or retain it.

20. The Coronation of Rudolf II in Regensburg
        Regensburg
        4 November 1575
    On All Saints’ Day there took place in the Cathedral of St. Peter of this town the coronation of the most august Sovereign, Rudolf, Roman Emperor Elect, accompanied by the customary ceremonies. There were present all the Electors and other Princes. The Archbishop of Mayence celebrated High Mass, and as the procession left the church two men on horseback scattered silver coin amongst the people. These bore on one side: “Rudolf II, elected King of Rome on the 22nd day of October 1575,” and on the other “Crowned on November 1st, 1575." It also showed a picture of an altar with six balls, over which stood: “Consentientibus Nobis." The crowds in the streets and on the square before the Town Hall were enormous. In the Town Hall seven tables were spread for the Electors. In front of the Town Hall a large ox was roasted, stuffed with all sorts of animals. There was also a fountain from the eight spouts of which there flowed red and white wine. The Emperor gave a magnificent banquet, at which each Elector had a table to himself. On the next day the King gave a second banquet for those who came from afar. The Elector of Bradenburg was the first to leave, for he had received news of the dying condition of his Consort.

21. The Plague in Venice
        unknown
        2 August 1576
    Order of the most excellent councillors chosen by the illustrious Senate for the provisioning of the City of Venice, 2nd day of August 1576.
    In order to give effect to the findings of the illustrious Senate of the 31st day of the past month, it is decreed in the interest of the general welfare and the extirpation of the contagious plague, that the streets of this city be closed for the duration of fourteen days. On no condition whatsoever are inhabitants to be allowed to move from one street to another. The Councillors charged with the provisioning of the city make known to one and all whether Venetian, or stranger, nobleman, burgher, tradesman, or of whatever rank he may be, that it is incumbent upon him, out of his own means and to the best of his ability, to provide as far as possible all needful provisions for his household, for himself, his workmen and others who are in his service; and to take good care that sufficient water be in store in his well for the afore mentioned period of fourteen days. All this must be carried out by the coming Saturday. Likewise we command all fishermen, dealers in fruit, in meat, and all others who traffic in foodstuffs, also all those who offer for sale oil, faggots and wood, to furnish their shops at once with sufficient goods and to hold them for sale in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of their street. Likewise, by the order of the illustrious Councillors it is announced that all kinds of provisions are to be purchased elsewhere and to be brought into the city. This will be facilitated and promoted by all means, and it will be permissible to trade freely therewith wherever it may happen to be.
        Venice, 1 September 1576
    Yesterday the Senate carried a resolution whereby it was decided to buy from the physician in the hospital the remedy against the present contagious plague, which he has repeatedly offered. He was there and then paid 30,000 ducats and as many gold zechines. He and his heirs are, moreover, to receive 300 ducats every month. Yesterday the secret was made public and as soon as I receive a copy of this I will send it to Your Serene Highness.

22. Invasion of Livonia by the Russians
        unknown
        30 August 1577
    background: Truthful, pitiable and lamentable news, written by a personality of high standing from Riga, of the horrors of the Muscovite Tyranny.
    You will doubtless have learnt to a sufficiency of the unheard-of tyranny together with pillaging, murder, burnings, rapes, incest, which the Muscovite practised from the 13th day of July to the 30th day of August in practically the whole Duchy. I believe that these lamentations and this outcry cannot have been heard among the Germans. For if our Government but knew of this and believed therein, it would feel commiseration for their poor, wretched forsaken and forgotten subjects and take pity on them, though their hearts be made of steel and stone.
    In the month of July the enemy passed through the breadth and length of the country, with eleven thousand men, ravaging, burning, and taking all prisoners. Those who were aged or offered opposition were slain and in this wise three thousand people are said to have perished. It is reported that nine thousand young men have been made prisoners. The first of their hordes we could well have vanquished by God’s grace, if we had made common cause with the Courlanders and the peasants. For the Musovite had remained behind with his chief troops and the cannon, but when he saw that we were separated, defenceless and without guns, he continued his murdering tyrannical course, taking one after the other, all the towns and localities. In one place they took forty women and virgins into a garden; they were violated there and then for hours by Muscovites without number. Then they were put on horses and taken away. The Muscovite is said to be on his way to Nonnenburg with his artillery. A few places are still holding out, but the Lord grant that our rulers may realize their obligations and not permit their poor loyal subjects to be sacrificed on the shambles. The misery and grief to be seen in this country will not allow me to write any more.

23. Miraculous Healings by a Hermit
unknown
        25 June 1578
            background: Hans Noegl writes from Dillingen to Anton Bimmel the news of the 25th of June 1578.
    I cannot omit to report to Your Reverence thus: some days ago the reverend and highly learned Herr Venerandus Gabler, doctor of medicine at Tiedlingen, wrote a letter to the Provost of the College, wherein he tells, among other things, of a hermit at Toll in Burgundy, who performs miraculous doings and heals many sick people, of which Your Reverence may take cognizance from the attached copy. Should Your Reverence know of any unfortunate and sick persons, past all human aid, Your Reverence might well inform them to this effect: “I have received reliable news that there lives in Burgundy a hermit, who heals innumerable people—but only Catholics—from all manner of sickness, even those that are incurable. He has made the blind to see and the deaf to hear. Of late he has healed Magister Jacob, preacher at Freiburg in the Breisgau, who, afflicted with prolonged and severe pains, was therefore unable to use his limbs, so that he had to be carried and lifted. It is reported that in one single week there were four thousand sick people who visited this hermit, and that he aided the majority of them. The Commander of the District at Freiburg commends this to the consideration of our Commander. If there should be among the Jesuits or their relatives or pupils any sick person whom human knowledge is no longer able to relieve, he should go to the holy hermit, Vitus by name. Ills which arise in man from heredity or the French disease he will not accept for healing. He uses only prayer and fresh water and accepts nothing, no matter whosoever it be. He is greatly talked about by people of quality. This much have I wished not to withhold from Your Reverence’s friendly and well-meaning consideration in case you should not already be informed of it. Herewith I commend you and all your brotherhood to Divine Mercy.”

24. Death of King Sebastian of Portugal
        Lisbon 
        25 August 1578 
    I cannot hide from you the regrettable and unheard-of disaster which befell our King and his whole army in Africa. On the 3rd day of this month, our King marched forward to encounter the enemy, meaning to arrive at Alcazar on the same day. Now it happened that Mome Malucho was lying in wait for the King’s forces outside Alcazar with fourteen thousand men on horseback and on foot, and he sent an advance guard of about four thousand mounted troops in order to skirmish with them. This filled our King with gladness, so that he ordered his whole army to advance. The Captains of the Germans and the Italians did not deem this wise and they came of their own accord to the King to inform him that the soldiery were in no fit condition, and, moreover, tired, because they had had naught to eat for a long while. They craved therefore that they might be allowed to entrench themselves and to wait until provisions and more fighters were brought up from the fleet. The King had in all not more than twenty-three thousand men on foot and sixteen hundred on horseback. The remainder of his forces he had left behind with his fleet or had bidden them to accompany the Sherif, Mulei Mehemed, who had marched on Masegna, and whose father fell in the ensuing battle. But when the King had listened to the counsel of both Commanders, he shook his head and said: “Let us march, let us march!”  He ordered such great haste to be made that the cannon, which had formerly headed the army, was finally left behind and in the end unable to come to their assistance. Thereupon the King in person, with his horsemen began the skirmish with four thousand men. In the meanwhile more and more Turks joined in, until at last their whole army hastened on the scene in half-moon formation, surrounding our forces and taking the cannon, which fired from behind, but could hit no one but our own men.
    The Portuguese nobility withstood the onslaught for an hour, but they almost all fell on the battlefield. Likewise the Germans, Italians and Spaniards sold their lives dearly. But no more than ten or twelve of them came away alive. The rest were slain with their captains. But the Portuguese infantry surrendered at an early hour. Some of them shot first and then ran away, and some let their blunderbusses drop and surrendered.
    Our King bore himself right bravely, and, so it is said, killed many Turks with his own hands, but at last, after he had mounted the third horse, he disappeared so that no one has found him either alive or dead until this hour.
    Among the noblemen, of whom not more than sixteen are left, there is also the son of the Duke of Braganza, a young Lord, who drove in a gilt coach to meet the enemy. He had a thousand riflemen with him which his father had given him for his protection. But these were all mown down, and the young Lord was taken from the carriage, for he was believed to be the King. The Turks threw him twice into the air for joy, but he cried out that he was not the King, but the son of the Duke of Braganza, and besought them that his life might be spared as his father would ransom him with much money. With this the Turks were well satisfied.
    When this sorry news came unto us, you can well imagine how great were the lamentations, the despair and the grief, not only in this city, but in all the land. The men went about as if dazed. The wailing of the women was so loud that it can be compared with that which arose at the taking of Antwerp. It is a woeful matter to lose in one day the King, their husbands, their sons, and all the goods and chattels they had with them. But what is even more terrible is that this kingdom now must fall under Spanish rule, which they can brook the least of all. May God Almighty therefore perform a miracle by our pious old Cardinal, who is a man of sixty-four, and grant him a male heir. It is also said that His Highness is willing to marry for the sake of this kingdom. Although there were others of the royal blood, such as the Infant Antonio, they have all fallen in this battle. Not one is left but our Cardinal, who made his way here at once on receiving the pitiful tidings. As is reported, the pledge of loyalty will be sworn unto him next week.
    Otherwise business here continues as though nothing untoward had taken place. The ships that arrived from India are being unloaded, the merchants ply their trade and go to sea; it is the nobility and soldiers alone who have perished. No merchant has suffered thereby since they all stayed behind. The four regents whom the King appointed to rule the kingdom in his absence were ratified in their office by the Cardinal. The Government and officials deal with the people in so friendly a manner that every one is astounded thereat. In spite of these terrible tidings no riots have occurred and if a stranger, who had never been here before came to this city, he would swear by all that is holy that no ill-fortune has befallen this kingdom for one hundred years.
    This letter has lain here for lack of news until the 25th. To-day definite information arrived that our King fell in battle and was taken by the Moors to one of their cities, Alcazar by name. His adversary, the Moorish King Malucho, and the other Sheriff have also perished, therefore in one and the same battle three Kings and many noblemen on both sides were slain.
    The Cardinal was appointed yesterday Governor of the Kingdom by the Council, and, as decisive news of the King’s death has been received, he is to be elected King to-morrow.

25. Coronation of King Henry of Portugal
unknown
unknown
            background: Short report on the ceremonies attendant on the bewailing of the late King Don Sebastian and the election of the Cardinal of Portugal, Don Enrique, as King.
    On the 27th day of August of the year 1578 a nobleman stepped forth from the Town Hall in Lisbon, clad in black brocade, wearing a long robe closed in front, and trailing behind. Outside the Town Hall he bestrode a horse decked in black. He was given to hold in his hand a large black flag which he let trail on the ground. Three men went before him who were robed in long black cloaks which they also let drag far behind them. Each of them carried a wooden shield. First they went as far as the big church and one of them mounted the highest step and cried out aloud: “Citizens, I give you tidings that your King Don Sebastian is dead!”  Thereupon he splintered his buckler against the stone steps. Then they went to the Rua Nova, cried the same news there and broke the second buckler. From there they went to the Hospital where they destroyed the third one. These four men were followed by all the officials of the city, clad in black silken cloaks, also by innumerable crowds who wept pitifully and cried aloud: “Oh! what shall we do?”  They kicked one another with their feet and tore their hair. They also ran against the walls with their heads and did other things that were passing strange. The next day, on the morning of the 28th, between eight and nine o’clock, the Cardinal rode from the Palace of the Duke of Braganza, where he had lived, and went on his way to the Hospital. He sat on his mule, which was harnessed in beautiful red cloth, and he was clad in a long red robe. On his head he wore a Cardinal’s hat. Three counts led the mule by the halter. All the noblemen present in Lisbon—there were but few of them on account of the African battle—preceded him bareheaded and behind him went all the officials, Alcaldes and such like. Then followed six trumpeters on horseback clad in red and white damask and then three mounted drummers in black. Then came six men on horseback each of whom held a large, heavy silver mace in his hand and thereafter nine heralds in handsome doublets. They had the King’s coat of arms on back and front. Behind them rode the Duke of Braganza on a beautiful steed. He carried in his hand an unsheathed gilt sword. On his right walked Don Juan Delo. Near the Hospital there had been erected a high tribune. The Cardinal stepped on to this and took his place on a delicately wrought royal chair. In front of him there stood a table on which lay a book. When the Cardinal was seated a nobleman prostrated himself at his feet and tendered the royal sceptre unto him. Thereupon the Secretary Miguel de Moto took his oath that he would respect the privileges and liberties granted to the country by its former Kings. He then returned again amidst the sound of the trumpets and the kettledrums with unfurled standards to the house of the Duke of Braganza, who with the heralds rode ahead of him with unsheathed sword. The heralds called out in loud tones throughout the city: “Real! Real! Real!”  These cries were heard almost all day. May Almighty God give unto this King a long life and make his rule felicitous.

26. Murders in Paris
        Paris
        5 December 1578
    Of news we have none, save that on the last day of November the Secretary of the Duke of Florence, who together with the Ambassador has been here a year or two, was taken into custody by the Court Provost by order of the King. It is supposed that this was done because of several murders which were committed here some time ago, and which the Duke of Florence is said to have instigated. Not long since he caused Don Troilus d’Orsini to be shot at night by his servants between the hours of eight and nine. Suspicion falls upon him because the said Troilus stood in too close a friendship with the Duke’s sister. Some fourteen days ago, a Florentine, of the name of Capitano Bernardo, was shot in the suburb of St. Germain. The culprit was caught and put to the rack. After all his members had been broken, he was given water to drink twice as he lay on the wheel. It was only then that much information was gained from him, and it is said he confessed that he had taken money from the said Secretary to commit this and the other crime. The culprit was an Italian who has already done six people to death.

28. A Christ taken Prisoner
        Seville, 8 June 1579
    Of news we have none of import to give you these days. But a curious occurrence recently took place five miles from here, in a village, St. Ginar by name. An inhabitant thereof took refuge in the church to escape his creditors. But whereas, according to custom, on the day of the Blessed Sacrament, all kinds of entertainment were to take place before the Procession of the Blessed Host, some inhabitants had erected a cart, on which they wished to hold a mystery play showing how our Lord Jesus Christ was captured by the Jews as he was kneeling on the Mount of Olives. But they stood in need of a stately and beauteous man and knowing of none more worthy or better looking, they craved of the man, who had taken refuge in the church because of his debts, that he would play the part of the Lord God in their play. He resisted for a long time as he dared not leave the church on account of those to whom he owed money, but the others gave him the assurance that they would bring the cart, on which the play was to be held, in front of the church; where he could mount and descend and need not harbour fear. Thereupon the latter consented. But when one of his creditors learnt this, he bethought himself of many ways in which he could have his debtor seized and thrust into prison. To that end he held counsel with an Alguazil, who informed him that he had a good friend who would play the part of Judas in the said performance. This man he would present with half a dozen ducats and instruct him that, when they arrived on the Market Place, and Judas gave our dear Lord the kiss, he should likewise give him a strong push, so that he might fall from the cart. Once he touched the ground he would immediately be made prisoner. This proposal pleased the creditor greatly. He thereupon gave the Alguazil some money and promised him more as soon as he had got his debtor into prison. thus when the procession reached the market, where the Alguazil and his minions were lying in wait, Judas at once strove to carry out his purpose, and with the Jews proceeded to approach the Lord, whom he took to the tail of the cart, where he gave him so forcible a kiss and a push, that he fell to the ground. The Alguazil captured him then and there; but as the good Lord was looking most woefully at his disciples, St. Peter, who stood next to him with his sword, took pity upon him and almost cleft the Alguazil’s head in twain. Thereupon a great turmoil ensued in the whole village, so that the Justice intervened and arrested St. Peter, the Lord, and Judas with all his Jews. Thereupon the Judge proclaimed: S E N T E N T I A, Firstly, Judas to be given the birch for a scoffer of God. Secondly, the Alguazil to have himself physicked at his own cost. Thirdly, St. Peter to be set free, as a pious and faithful apostle, and the Lord likewise. The merchant to forfeit that which the Lord owes unto him and to make no further demands upon him for all eternity.
    Of this, for lack of better news, have I wished to give tidings unto you.

29. Tournaments in Prague
        Prague
        15 June 1579
    On the 5th day of this coming month of July, Christopher Popel, the Chamberlain of His Royal and Imperial Majesty, is to hold his nuptials with the daughter of the late Molard, here in Prague, where, at the same time as other frolic, there will be held such like jousts, at which Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria will be Mantenator, as are set forth in the challenge attached hereby. Above all be it known that: whereas the lofty and supreme Pallas, the Goddess of Wisdom and Arms has heard the news that the Knights of the far-famed and illustrious roman Court exercise themselves in an elegant, yet manly fashion, in all manner of knightly prowess, with assiduity, diligence, zeal and fervour, she has derived therefrom no little joy, being a lover and patron of such arts. To encourage Knights to even greater perseverance and ardour in the exercise of armed skill, and to restrain them from idleness from which spring vice and mischief of all kinds, also to fire them with greater zest in the practice of jousts, she has recalled from the Campis Eysiis, the mighty Knight Philotetus of Greece, who performed such doughty deeds at the siege of Troy and showed himself specially versed in the arts of joust, above all others. Him she sent to the Royal Capital of Prague, in order that he might there promote a new joust with the honourable knighthood. All this she does the more willingly, since she learnt that in the coming month of July there is to take place a notable and stately wedding in the aforementioned city of Prague, at which, doubtless many a good Knight will be present. Therefore, the great Goddess aforenamed wishes one and all of the knighthood to know that they have been asked to attend upon the 6th day of the coming month of July at 12 o’clock at noon, in the square Philocteti, in Prague, in order to essay a new and famous joust under the aforementioned Knight Philotetus as Mantenator. To prove more clearly the pleasure and delight which the mighty Goddess takes in the knighthood and their love of jousts, she has decreed that her own picture or statue be erected on the said square, so that it may serve for this new joust and also act as a fresh incentive, and instil into the whole knighthood even greater joy and enthusiasm. She will also be present at the time stated and at the appointed place. In what guise prizes are to be won or lost at this joust, and how people are to deport themselves follows hereunder: The figure erected will hold in its hand an iron ring or an iron target, at which competitors are to tilt or whereon they are to break their spears. The aforementioned Mantenator will run three carreras with each of the competing Venturiers for a Pretium (prize) of ten to one hundred thalers. Likewise such races are to be run in masques without weapons or armour of any sort, iron gloves or such like privilege. To this end each Venturier is to present himself to the Judge in order that it may be seen and proved that he does not have such advantage or make use of it over the Mantenator.
    No one is to run with spears other than those which are handed out by the Judges. Whoever, in the three races breaks several spears on the target, will be deemed to have won the Pretium. Two hits are to count for one broken spear. Whoever tilts the spear lower than the target, either in jumping or in running, ere he arrives thereat, and missing it, again raises the spear and then makes a hit or breaks the spear, is to be held as having won the race. Whoever takes his aim before, or in the act of jumping, is to be disqualified. Whoever breaks the spear after the race or in parrying across the shoulder so that it touches the shoulder, is not to be permitted to win. Whoever grasps (or handles) the spear improperly or is lacking in the elegance required from him, is likewise held to have lost the prize. No one is to be allowed to change his steed during the three carreras. If anyone through soreness of foot or other such legitimate cause be prevented from completing the race, he may be permitted to run in another, but should his horse not run properly and so make it impossible for him to finish the race, he will then be held to have lost it.
    Should the Mantenator and a Venturier obtain the same points in the breaking of the spear or hitting the target, they are not to run again; but he has won, who, according to the verdict of the Judge has carried himself through the race in the most elegant and seemly fashion. Since it has occurred at various times that the Pretium was accorded even to those who ran with but little grace, the Mantenator craves of the Judges that they keep a keen eye upon the manner in which the race is run because the Mantenator has much to do with the race, and the Venturier but little. This is case he and the Venturier have scored alike in breaking and hitting. The Judges, in order to award the prize, are not to take into account the number of the runs, but the graceful bearing of the competitors during the race. Should doubts arise, they are to be left to the competence of the Judges.
    Herewith and finally the Mantenator craves of the Judges that they adjudicate strictly and solely according to this capitulation. This much will the worthy Knight Philotetus always deserve from the Judges.
    Thereupon follow the prizes:
    Whosoever breaks the first spear most gracefully and felicitously on the target or the ring, is to win the first prize.
    Whosoever in three races, breaks the most spears, or makes the most hits also wins a prize.
    Whosoever breaks the most spears in a Folia, is to receive accordingly the Folia prize.
    Whosoever is hailed by the eminent Goddess as Mascolo, is to win the Mascolo prize.
    From these four prizes, the Mantenator, as is customary, will not consider himself to be excluded.

30. Letter from Cochin-China
        Cochin in India, 10 January 1580
    Honourable, most kindly and dear Signor Adelgais!
    Before my departure from Lisbon I informed you how I with my companions boarded our ships. Upon the 4th day of April 1579 all five vessels sailed from Lisbon at the same time; but we did not however, keep together for more than six days, but each soon struck out on its own course, since each captain or pilot believes he knows best how to arrive first at the goal. Although these ships are big and powerful, they strive not to stay together. When we had been on our way for a month and had chanced first on the coast of Guinea and later upon the Linea Aequinoxialis, we realized that we had left Lisbon far too late. We had to sail back and forth along this Linea until we could pass it, and in this wise lost forty-seven days. Since at this time the sun shines at its strongest and hottest, we had to suffer great heat and torment on this voyage. From thence as far as the thirty-fourth degree in the other half of the globe, towards the South pole or the Pole Antarctico, as far as the Cape of Good Hope, we had a favourable wind and fair weather, but severe cold. From thence onward we experienced several great storms. To tell the truth, I would have preferred then to be elsewhere than on this voyage. God be praised, we came through. But it is an old experience in seafaring that come or go, one has to meet such storms. This danger lasts for one hundred and fifty miles, which one covers in thirty-four days. We then arrived at the twenty-sixth degree off the height of Mozambique. There the King of Portugal keeps a fort and a garrison. But whereas it was late in the year, we were not permitted to land, but stayed out at sea fifty miles therefrom. If we had gone ashore, we should not have been able to leave again. We then came upon the Linea Aequinoxialis which we passed in three days. Thereupon we passed on again to the other side towards the North Pole.
    Here in Cochin we are situate on the ninth degree from this line and on the side of Europe. Lisbon lies thirty-nine degrees off this line. In this place it is rather warm since we are just under the ninth degree. We arrived, thanks and praise be to the Lord Almighty, upon the 10th day of October at the town of Goa, which belongs to the King of Portugal and is the finest capital in this country. Thus we have been on our way here from Lisbon six months and six days, and during that time have seen no land, only the sky and the sea. The Lord God bestows on such journeys His special blessing and mercy, for otherwise it would not be possible to spend half a year between the planks. To sum up, whosoever is well equipped with provisions and a cook, both of which were mine, thanks to the Lord, feels the hardships of such a voyage less than the common people, who suffer great distress from lack of food and drink, especially water, which no money can buy. In such heat one cannot partake of much wine, only water, of which, thanks be to God, I had in sufficient quantity with our food. There were about five hundred persons in our ship of whom not more than twenty-five altogether died on the way from Portugal to India. Some of us, who were well provided with food and drink, extended much help to the poor soldiery. In this half year we have traversed five thousand miles. Although for the direct route from Lisbon to India one counts not more than three thousand miles, one covers at all times for each voyage five thousand miles on account of the head winds.
    I have seen many kinds of fish, whereof there would be much to write, especially of those that fly above the sea and have wings. This many will not wish to believe, but I have seen them a thousand times fly as near as the musket will carry. What called forth still greater surprise on my part were other big fishes that are in the ocean and that eat man alive, whereof I have been myself a witness. For when a man fell from our ship into the sea during a strong wind, so that we could not wait for him or come to his rescue in any other fashion, we threw out to him on a rope a wooden block, especially prepared for that purpose, and this he finally managed to grasp and thought he could save himself thereby. But when our crew drew this block with the man toward the ship and had him within half the carrying distance of a musket shot, there appeared from below the surface of the sea a large monster, called Tiburon; it rushed on the man and tore him to pieces before our very eyes. That surely was a grievous death.
    There were also many kinds of birds upon the sea, among them many which never see land, but always dwell upon the waters. They eat fish and do not fear the people on the ship. We have with our hands caught several of these birds. They are the size of ducks, but are reputed not to be fit to eat, because they smack so strongly of fish.
    I have related our journey day by day, and have made therewith a book, which in good time, if God helps me out of this again, I shall bring with me together with many beauteous things. This voyage is of such nature that he who does not experience it himself, could not believe how arduous it is. Thanks be to God, that myself and my men, four young Germans, have arrived here in India fresh and well; but no sooner did we set foot on land, than four young Portuguese servants of mine expired. On the ship eating and much drinking of water causes havoc, and ashore it is dangerous for some time, because of the many fruits, such as figs and other foods. But also there is a danger on account of the women, of whom there is an abundance. From all the ships a good many men died ashore. Until a man gets acclimatized he has to guard himself wisely. Thanks be to God, I am very well.
    Our ships have all five arrived from Lisbon, namely, three in Goa and two here. Now all five ships are here in Cochin. I made a sojourn of four weeks in the town of Goa and built me there a house. From thence I travelled one hundred miles onwards by sea. The voyage can be made in ten to twelve days. The ships are loaded with pepper here in Cochin, twenty miles from Calicut, wherefore they all have to come to this place. I shall maintain two establishments, one in Goa and the other here. I have not yet, however, resolved upon which shall fall my choice for remaining definitely. Although Goa is the capital in which the Viceroy of Portugal holds his Court, it is wearisome to journey back and forth every year, as I needs must be present in this our pepper store.
    Such a pepper store is a fine business, but it requires great zeal and perseverance. It takes six weeks to receive the pepper from the heathen King of Cochin, who is our friend, and to load it into our ships. After the departure of these ships for Portugal I and my servants have but little to do. The pepper business is profitable indeed; when the Lord God grants by His mercy that none of the ships take damage either in coming or going, then the merchants wax rich. With these sailings, all depends upon the right time to take the journey, to wit, during the month of March from Lisbon to this place, and from here to Portugal during the month of January. Also, when this can be arranged, to leave neither place later than upon the 15th day of these months. Then the risk is slight. But it is dangerous to take one’s departure later, for then one comes across heavy storms, and has to go by a circuitous route, and often the ships are destroyed. This happens but rarely, provided the ships do not run aground, founder or otherwise come to grief. Great caution has to be practised in these respects.
    This year, in my judgment, we shall not dispatch more than four ships with about twenty loads, although we ought to send thirty. We already possess the money, for so large a sum would not be obtainable by loan. What we are lacking this day can be bought, given a good opportunity, after the sailing of these ships for next year. Of all other spices such as cloves, nutmeg, flour and nuts, cinnamon, maces, and various drugs, this year’s supplies are going to Portugal. In precious stones little was dispatched this year on account of the war, which the heathen Kings (of which there are many in this country) waged one upon another. Because of this, precious stones cannot come through from inland into our towns since all of them lie upon the shores of the sea.
    All that lieth inland belongs to the Indians, heathens and Moors. We boast of the friendship of two or three of these Kings, but the majority are our enemies. Our fleet is continually fighting them at sea. The King of Portugal despite all his power is too weak for this vast country. The King of Spain, if he but took possession of Portugal, would be the right King for these lands. He should take over the whole of India all the kingdoms and provinces right into China, where it adjoins Tartary, and unite under his rule his Spanish India with the Portuguese municipalities: this he could accomplish with fifty thousand men. Even though the Kindian Kings have a goodly number of warriors, and there are many such Kings, they are not good fighters. One Christian can achieve more than six Indians. Besides, these Kings are continually involved in strife and quarrels amongst themselves.
    The land in itself is bad, it produces all the corn, rice and meat that is needed, but no wine and no olive oil: it also lacks five or six kinds of fruit. Wine, oil and Dutch cheese are brought from Portugal. The country is equally warm throughout the year, in winter as in summer. There exists no difference in the seasons. In winter it is as hot as in summer, only that it rains throughout the whole winter, which in summer it does not do. The days are of twelve hours’ duration all the year round, they grow neither longer nor shorter. The trees and grass remain verdant throughout the year. We have figs here that are as large as the span of the hand, which figs are picked from the trees the whole year round. One may pick them every day, they are the most important and the staple food for rich and poor alike. It grows on beautiful tall trees, which are called palms. These bear a fruit of the size and shape of a melon which contains much water. Whosoever does not know or see it, cannot imagine what manner of things can be made from this fruit. Thou canst however completely trust in me, for my information is good.
    From this fruit one maketh wine, which is good to drink, also oil which is good for eating and burning, also milk and fat and a special paper on which one can write. This fruit is kept in store rooms. Its husk is used for making wooden crockery, dishes and other things. Moreover, one makes out of these trees all that is needed for navigation, to wit, the ship, mast, sails, nails, ropes, cables, tow, and likewise wooden bricks for roofing houses. These ships carry provisions in food and drink which are also derived from this tree. I have already seen myself ships thus fashioned. It is a strange thing, and I have desired not to omit to advise thee of this with all the other curiosities here. With God’s help, I will write to thee in this coming year more particulars about curious customs and strange happenings; but they are as yet new to me, though I have already been in this country for three months. Every day I see new usages about which one might write a large book. I will endeavour, as time goes on to collect many strange things and after five years, if I continue in my present purpose, to take them home with me. God willing, I shall employ for my home-coming another route, namely, one by land. From here one goes by sea towards Ormus in Arabia, thence to Persia and there one has good opportunity to travel through the Sophi’s land and Turkey. As I learn from those that come and go from Italy, this is a very good road, for it is much used. One finds people in Ormus who assure one that they will bring you safely from Ormus to Italy. It appears quite a common thing. I shall, however, inform myself well beforehand since I have the time to do so. By this route it is not quite two thousand miles from here to Italy or Germany and these one can cover within six months: moreover the Holy Land and Jerusalem and other such like places can be visited on the way, and so I feel much more inclined to see something more of these lands, than to go by sea, where one is in hourly peril of the ship suffering damage or being wrecked.
    I ought to recount to thee many other such strange things, which however cannot be done at this moment. In the coming year I will send thee a picture to show how every one is dressed here, to wit, bare or naked, man and women. The King and noblemen as well as the common man, only cover their shame. The Portuguese are clad only in very light garments, linen or silk. On account of the heat, woollens cannot be worn. People here have many beliefs and ceremonies. But as time goes, more and more Indians are converted to Christendom though others remain heathens. The Moors and the Jews retain their Faith. In these lands many creeds exist, but in the towns belonging to the Portuguese, the heathens or Indians are mostly converted to the Christian Faith. I also cannot omit to tell you of another custom of this country. All the Kings have always thirty, forty, yes, even one hundred wives, as many as it pleases them to keep. When such a King dies or perishes in battle, these his wives must throw themselves into the fire and burn to death. In many places outside this town it is the custom also among the common heathen people that the widow of a dead heathen must likewise allow herself to be burnt alive. If she does not, she is mocked and derided. There exists still another custom. When a maiden of a noble house or of reputed ancestry marries, her kinsmen strive to persuade the King to sleep with her the first night. Much money is given to him to that end, otherwise she cannot marry. Of such customs there are many more besides this.
    Also, I would tell thee that the five ships from Portugal were sent to our master. Thou shouldst know that from the sale of wine, oil, Dutch Cheese, fish, paper and other things, usually the greatest profit is derived; this time no gain at all remains. All this has brought in no more than twelve to fifteen per cent., and on the ready cash brought from Lisbon one makes but a profit of twenty-five per cent. The country is no longer as it was formerly, and apart from this, our Viceroy imposes so many new taxes that all commerce diminishes. If he remains here, no good will come of it. I am of the belief however, that the King of Portugal will send hither another Viceroy when he hears of the doings of this present one. There is no merchandise now that can be sent with profit from here to Portugal.
    In precious stones there is nothing this year; in fact this country is not such as is generally imagined. It takes as much trouble to earn money here as in other places. Things are no longer what they were twenty years ago. Buying and selling here is more profitable than sending many wares to Portugal. German merchandise has no market here and is useless for this country. Writing tables split in the great heat, clockwork, or anything else made of iron, deteriorates at sea. This year there is nothing to send to Portugal, for pepper, ginger, maces, cocoa-nut fat have all been brought for the contractors, also cinnamon for the King. One really does not know this time in what to invest one’s money.
    The fisher has imported Dutch cheese, but is not going to derive great profit from it, since much of it was stolen aboard ship. This likewise happened to our stores. In addition, our sales have been bad. Five ships can bring much into port, and thus everything becomes cheap. The Portuguese here are even more diligent than the people in Lisbon. The Pietras de Bezoar are always very dear and not good. After the ships have departed I will try to obtain privately some of these stones that are good, and to send them to thee next year.

31. The Death of Philippine Welser
        Innsbruck, 1580
    The Most Serene Princess and Lady, Philippine, Consort of the Serene and Highborn Prince and Lord, Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, was taken ill by Divine Ordinance of God Almighty, on the 14th day of April of the year 1580, and has on the 24th day of the said month, taken leave from this vale of tears in a Christian, peaceful and exemplary manner.
    After the most worthy Princess had felt very weak on the 23rd day of the above-named month, she made her confession, according to Catholic custom and at the advice and instigation of her Father Confessor, in deep repentance and sorrow. The ensuing day, between 5 and 6 o’clock in the morning she received the Blessed Sacrament with special devoutness, and several hours thereafter, Extreme Unction with great reverence. But her strength ebbing little by little, she implored her Lord and Spouse, in submission and humility, graciously to extend his pardon to her, in case she had not always lived obediently as was the gracious will and pleasure of His Princely Highness, or contravened his wishes by word or deed. The pious Princess gave proof of so great and constant a forbearance that not one single sign of impatience was she seen to make.
    She was heard to say several times that she was willing and ready to suffer patiently these and other pains, as long as the dear Lord willed it thus. Whereas even in her death struggle she preserved her consciousness and clear speech, she listened with joy when spoken to about heavenly matters and herself continuously begged God for forgiveness of her sins, for patience, perseverance in the Christian Faith and for help against all wicked temptations. She often and firmly prayed:
    “Oh, Thou merciful God, forgive me my sins and trespasses. Father, I have sinned before Heaven and before Thee and am not worthy to be called Thy Child. Lord, let my soul be cleansed in Thy rose-red blood, let Thy bitter Death and Thy joyful Resurrection be my victory and triumph.”
    Although she had been warned on account of her bodily weakness not to say the prayers aloud, she was yet able to manifest that in her heart she repeated all those that were said in her presence, especially the Paternoster, the Angelus, and the Credo. Likewise, many beautiful things did she say during the last moments of her life. The cross of Indulgence with which she had been honoured by His Holiness the Pope she was seen to kiss reverently and unceasingly and on three occasions she was heard to laugh unexpectedly. And as His Serene Highness questioned her why she was laughing, she made answer: “I see that which gladdens me.”
    She was by nature of so virtuous and modest a dispostion that even in her death agony she would not permit the least uncovering of her body, and drew her sleeves over her arms down to her wrists. She humbly commended her brother, Herr Carl Welser, Chief Chamberlain to His Highness, to the favour of Her Serene Spouse. When she at last became aware that God was about to make an end of her, she gazed lovingly at His Serene Highness and gave him her right hand with the words: “May God take care of you!”  Thereupon she imparted to her most beloved sons the motherly warning not to displease their father, but to render unto him most perfect obedience. Likewise, she gave her blessing to Herr Ferdinand, Duke of Upper and Lower Bavaria, and Herr Otto Heinrich, Duke of Brunswick. She bade the Duke of Bavaria to take leave in her name of all the princely house of Bavaria. She counselled Herr Jaroslav of Kolowrat, a young nobleman and blood relation, to avoid giving His Serene Highness any cause for displeasure. Shortly afterwards, she stretched forth her right hand to all present and commended them to God. When the Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria had held the burning candle for her for a long time, she said to His Serene Highness: “Your Dilection is getting tired!”  In short, Her Serene Highness conducted herself until the very last with complete and unimpaired intelligence, in a most Christian and God-fearing manner, in word and deed towards God and her relatives. To the Eternal and bounteous Deity, from Whom sprang the blessed dead, be all Praise, Honour and Glory for all times! May He grant this Christian Princess a glorious resurrection. Amen, dear Lord Jesus Christ! Amen!

32. Disputes at the Court of Prague
        Prague, 15 May 1580
    Last week, Monsieur de Roche, Imperial Carver, and Allegret d’Allegretti, Imperial Lord High Steward, fell into dispute while gambling in the refectory. They unsheathed their rapiers, against one another. Whereupon the following sentence was passed in the presence of all Court officials: Monsieur de Roche as originator of this and other quarrels after serving his sentence of imprisonment, is to be confined for a further month in the White Tower here. Thereafter he is to quit the Imperial Court, and to shun this, as well as all the Hereditary Lands of the Crown at the risk of body and soul. Allegret d’Allegretti, after having served his term of imprisonment, is to leave the Emperor’s Court within fifteen days and to be banished from it for ever. This punishment has been ordained at the personal behest and order of His Imperial Majesty.

33. The Spaniards Conquer Lisbon
        Lisbon, 1 September 1580
    My neglect in writing to you for so long a time is due to the war and strife we have had here. For on the 25th day of August the Duke of Alba conquered Lisbon at the point of the sword. The saying goes that nigh upon three thousand persons perished on the side of the Portuguese, part of whom I myself have seen in the outer town. The dead lay heap on heap like swine. I went in the company of the Count of Lodron, who is quartered in our house, to the field of battle. All the streets are filled with dead men and horses, so that we had to walk across them as on a bridge. Some are still alive, one man lifted a foot, another a hand, yet another his head. Altogether it was a pitiable sight. The outer town also which is much larger than the town proper, was plundered for the duration of three whole days. Everything was taken away. Not a nail in the wall was left. But no soldiers came into the town, because the Duke of Alba sternly forbade it. The army is still encamped without the town. Thanks be to God, no harm has come to us.
    Four days ago five ships arrived here from India. One more was to have come which had sailed this year for Portuguese India, but it turned back on its way. No one can say what became of the ships that were sent out to meet the fleet.

34. Execution of a Bohemian Nobleman for Street Robbery
        Prague
        30 October 1580
    I know nothing of note whereof to write to you, save that at the last session of the Provincial Law Court the beheading of a stately nobleman, of the name of Vodratsky, who had committed robbery, was ordered to take place, on the 20th day of the month. He was a man of about sixty years of age. His estates were worth over one hundred and fifty thousand thalers, and now they have all fallen to his Imperial Majesty. There was much sorrowing on his account, for after he was sentenced, his wife, with four daughters and two sons all prostrated themselves at the feet of the Emperor, the Empress, and the nobles of the land. This scene took place in public in the Diet Chamber and was most pitiable. His Imperial Majesty granted a reprieve, and Vodratsky might be alive and well now, yet he did not wish this, but said that whatsoever punishment was due to him, he was ready to take. fourteen days earlier he dined with Herr von Brunnenstein, who in vain attempted to dissuade him from his purpose. As he came out, free and unfettered from the palace he halted outside the Diet Chamber from whence the officers looked down upon him. With these he held converse for nigh on half an hour until the noble lords were moved to tears, for he entreated them on behalf of his children and commended them to their care, so that they might not be driven from his estates. Thereupon he wrote a letter in the Tower wherein he besought the people to forget him. This the aged Herr von Wartenberg, who has Vodratsky’s sister for spouse, communicated to His Majesty. Thereupon Herr von Wartenberg weeping, brought the following message: “The Clerk is to accept this letter and after the sentence has been carried out and Justice has received its due, it is to be read out in public." Whereupon he, Vodratsky, proceeded to his execution halting a long time before Herr von Dietrichstein and praying for his children. He then went valiantly to his death and was beheaded on a black cloth spread upon the ground. Not far from this spot a carriage waited with a bier thereon. The carriage was drawn by four horses draped in black, and behind it was led his favourite steed. When he had been executed, his servants wrapped him in the black shroud, laid him upon the bier and conveyed him to his domain, where he was buried.
    There are still many such fellows in this land, and as rumour has it, the names of one hundred and thirty are registered on a list.

35. War between the English and the Irish
        London
        19 November 1580
    From Ireland we receive the news that the Spaniards and rebels have taken up fortified positions upon the seashore at Smerwick where they are besieged by the English by land and water. A large ship from Spain laden with grain was forced by a ship of the Royal Fleet to run on to the rocks. The crew took refuge in the fortress, but the corn remained in the ship.
    Forty-six horses laden with gold and silver for the Treasury of the Queen, have arrived here this week, each horse carrying two hundred and twenty pounds in weight. It is believed that this represents her share for promising to defend Captain Drake. It seems as though he will again make an expedition to the Moluccas, which voyage he can accomplish there and back again within twelve months.

36. Wailings in Prague
        Prague
        14 February 1581
    A few days ago towards noon, just as we were about to partake of our meal, a noise resembling thunder or the fire of muskets, passed, travelling swiftly over the town. And during the ensuing night the sound of lamentation was heard behind the palace, and likewise by the look-out in the White Tower. The same cries also arose in the Old Town. The bohemians call this the “Mother in Travail,” who in time past has appeared, emitting similar wailings. Thereafter a terrible plague broke out so that people fell ill in the street, leaned against a wall, dropped to the ground and died. But none here pay heed to it, and the Bohemian people surrender themselves to godlessness and fornication. May God preserve us from sudden death and may He manifest His mercy unto us!

37. Religious Feuds in Antwerp
        Cologne
        20 April 1581
    Those of the Reformed Faith in Antwerp now covet the Church of St. Michael, which has been previously refused to the adherents of the Augsburg tenets. It is supposed however, that those aforementioned will obtain not only this church, but finally all the churches. On the 13th day of this month Burgomaster Junius arrived in Antwerp at the Convent of St. Clair with the renegade Abbot of St. Bernard. They urged upon the nuns that it was not good to live so secluded a life, and exhorted them to leave the cloister and to be married. The spouse of the said Abbot is especially reported to have spoken many lewd words. This is the beginning of an attempt to entice all the clerics from the monasteries and the town of Antwerp.

38. Iconoclasm in Belgium
        Antwerp
        2 May 1581
    Eight days ago the soldiery and the Calvinists mutilated all the pictures and altars in the churches and cloisters of Belgium. The clergy and near on five hundred Catholic citizens were driven out and several among them cast into prison. Thus an end has been made of the Catholic Faith in Brussels, and Calvinism has been installed in its stead. Since then, the masters of the guilds or brotherhoods, and the artisans, whose ancestors had founded several beautiful chapels and altars in the Church of our Dear Lady, have demanded that they themselves should be allowed to remove from the church the painted pictures and other ornaments. Upon the evening of the Feast of the Ascension they began to pull down the altars, occupied the churches and kept them locked until this day. . . . It is not known whether they will destroy everything within the church, but it is believed that it will come to pass here as it did in Brussels. . . . But as Catholics and Calvinists cannot keep peace with the Lutherans and Anapapists it will ill serve the promotion of commerce and many persons will leave this town.
        Antwerp, 6 May 1581
    Four ships lie here laden with sculptured and carved statues, bells, brass and stone effigies of saints, brass candlesticks and other such like ornaments from the churches. All these are to be dispatched to Narva and Moscow. The consigners hope to do good business with them.
        Antwerp, 5 July 1581
    In the past days the Calvinists here have wrought much havoc. On the day of St. Jacques they ravaged the Church of Our Lady, the Church of St. Jacques, and the Palace Chapel, as well as the Convent of St. Michel, where up to now the Catholics held their religious exercises and ceremonies, in such fashion that they have wrecked everything therein, with the exception of the organ and a few pictures. They spared nothing and destroyed everything completely. On the 27th day in broad daylight, a Captain of the burghers, a painter with sundry artisans went with large hammers and other iron instruments into all the monasteries, chapels, hospitals and other houses of God, in short to every place where there still existed pictures and altars and destroyed them. Many of the wooden effigies were burned in the streets, where the burghers kept guard. Not one person did protest against this, since the rule of the clergy is completely destroyed and at an end here.

        Antwerp
        15 July 1581
    This afternoon at 1 o’clock, the Town Council issued an announcement whereby it is no longer permitted to practise the Catholic Religion. It is still, however, permissible for Catholics to baptize their children in their own fashion and have their marriages blessed by their priests. The adherents of the Reformed Faith wish to have it all their own way, but this kind of rule will not endure as time goes on, and evil will arise from it, for too much rope is being given to the community.

42. The Citizens of Cologne rise against their Elector
        Cologne
        10 August 1581
    Recently it was reported that the citizens of Cologne had held before the town, a prize-shooting in musketry, which the Elector was not minded to sanction. The citizens, however, persisted and it so happened that upon the 4th day of the month the musketeers of His Grace came with divers horses from Neuss and were wishful to proceed to the Priel. The horses were led past far from the town, but the musketeers, about twenty-five to thirty, came across the field close by the town and wanted to see the shooting. The citizens and the contestants however, thought that they had come by order of the Elector to prevent the shooting. A turmoil arose during which one of the Elector’s musketeers was shot dead and eleven were taken prisoner. The alarm was given in the city and the rumour spread among the inhabitants that the Bishop was slaying the burghers and contestants before the gates of the town.Thereupon the inhabitants’ anger was roused and part of the people ran out to the assistance of those whom they believed to be attacked. Apart from this, the populace resolved to inflict much damage upon the clergy. It was most fortunate that the Bishop took no notice of the occurrence, otherwise but few of the richest clerics in the town would have escaped unscathed. Thus often from a small spark a large fire arises. It is hoped that the Elector and the town will make peace.

44. Suicide of a Protestant Minister on Account of Bigamy
    unknown
        4 October 1581
    Last Will and Testament of the Magister Johannes Scheerer. He was a Lutheran and was driven out of Nuremberg because he was known to have two wives. According to this his testament, he stabbed himself from despair.
    “Firstly, I have confessed all my sins to God and to my Saviour Jesus Christ, with Whom I shall shortly be, and have with all diligence recited the seven Penitential Psalms.
    “Secondly, I console myself with the words of my Lord Jesus Christ, who said ‘I am the way, the truth and the Life and the Resurrection, he whoever believeth in Me shall live even though he die.’
    “Thirdly, I commit my beloved and devout wife, together with our seven small children to the Holy Trinity, and all holy angels, that they may guard and care for them at all times. I also commend them to the honourable and wise Counsillors in this city, who, I trust, will be their father, in memory of the services of their father, and I leave this world joyously and blissfully. I have taken as my example all the saints who on account of life eternal, have held their bodies here in light esteem and have often jumped into the water or taken other means in order speedily to depart from this life. With peace and happiness I go. Cleobrotus, a heathen, died willingly from desire and joy in eternal life. How much more, then, shall a Christian do likewise?”

        24 October 1581
    On the 19th day of this month, the Elector of Saxony accompanied by his spouse, his son and a young Count Palatine of Zweibrücken arrived here with horses and carriages in fair number. His Imperial Majesty accompanied by as many of his Councillors and courtiers as were present, rode courteously to meet him. As soon as the Elector drew near, both the Emperor and the Elector dismounted from their horses, and the Electress and the young Princes descended from their carriages. They made several steps towards each other and were received by His Majesty in a most friendly manner. But when the Electress desired to re-enter her coach, His Majesty took hold of her in order to assist her. This she in no way desired to permit and so they pursued this show of courtesy for a full quarter of an hour. This caused great mirth to the Elector. Finally, His Majesty desisted and took the Elector and the two young Princes into the coach with him and by the mercy of God drove to the castle of Prague. All were astounded at the most gracious humility displayed by His Imperial Majesty.

All manner of things are said about this marriage, also that our King and his Lady Mother do not view it with displeasure. The French proverb holds good: Jeune folle, vieille enragée.

47. Terrifying Apparition in Spain.
        Madrid
        unknown
    In the country of Palamos, in the Kingdom of Catalunia, upon the 1st day of May, the day of the holy Apostles Felipe and Jaime, in the hamlet of Calongo there were seen by all the people a terrifying storm and a huge cloud, in which could be perceived a whole legion of evil spirits of various shapes and most loathsomely deformed. Some were like lions, others like wolves, others again, like dogs, and others like men or wild animals. Many also were like ravens and other black birds. The clergy proceeded to walk with the true cross from the church to the cemetery, in order to exorcize them. But all to no purpose: they paid no heed to it. When the Praepositus saw this, he carried forth the Blessed Sacrament. Then it was seen that most of the spirits rushed into a pond formed by a rivulet two stones’ throw distance from the village. Therefrom presently arose a great flame of fire and smoke, as broad and tall as a veritable belfry, rising to the very clouds. The flame stank most vilely of sulphur. Meanwhile many of the spirits circled like ravens round and round. Among them an especially frightful and terrifying bird. They tore up nine olive-trees, many nut and cherry-trees and also many tufts of grass and earth. One vineyard they burned.
    When it was seen that the storm would not cease, the Praepositus, with the most Blessed Sacrament, ascended to the church belfry, where there was such a violent wind that he fell backwards. The cross fell down from the tower without causing damage.
    From the clouds there fell much water which, however, caused but little harm. The inhabitants of this hamlet having witnessed such a gruesome and frightful occurrence remained in great fear.
    This was reported to the Supreme Council of Spain on the 22nd day of May.

49. Marriage of Archduke Ferdinand with the Princess of Mantua
        unknown
        unknown
            background: A short and simple account of what happened at the marriage of His Serene Highness Archduke Ferdinand of Austria with the Archduchess of Mantua.
    On Wednesday, the 9th day of May 1582, the gilt sword and the Archducal hat, which were sent to him by His Holiness the Pope through Franciscus, Bishop of Sebaste, were presented to His Serene Highness by the said Bishop after Mass had been said and the written message of His Holiness had been publicly read before the altar in the new cathedral at Innsbruck.
    On Friday, the 11th day of May, Duke William of Bavaria as the accredited Envoy to these nuptials of His roman Imperial Majesty arrived at Innsbruck in time for the morning meal with his beloved spouse, Maximiliana, sister of his princely grace, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, the two Landgravines of Baden, as well as a considerable number of Court attendants, counts, squires and noblemen, with four hundred horses in all. On the same evening the Archduke Charles of Austria arrived with his beloved Consort and the three princely offspring with a magnificent suite of attendants consisting of privy and trusted Councillors, counts, squires and noblemen, together with five hundred horses. His Serene Highness Archduke Ferdinand with his sons and Duke William of Bavaria came to meet them as far as Hall and accompanied them to Innsbruck. On the following Monday, the 14th day of May, the date of the nuptial ceremony and the entry, Archduke Ferdinand rode beyond the cloister of Wilten, alongside the mountain Isel, with Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria as Imperial Envoy, Archduke Charles of Austria, Cardinal Andreas of Austria and their stately and impressive retinue. Among the courtiers were Count Wilhelm von Zimbern, who entered Innsbruck with forty-one horses, Count Hannibal von Hohenembs, the Counts von Thurn, Schwarzenberg, Liechtenstein, Ortenburg and many other counts, squires and noblemen. From Innsbruck as far as the mountain Isel there lined up five thousand lansquenets and arquebusiers, clad in armour. Several tents had been erected on this spot, among them two which were particularly large. There their Serene Highnesses dismounted and awaited the royal bride, who presently arrived with her mother, the Duchess of Mantua, Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria and the Margrave of Baden. These two Princes had been dispatched on a mission to Mantua with eighty horses to accompany the plighted bride. The members of the Court and the squires of Tyrol had been sent to meet her as far as the frontier below Rovereto. They remained in the other tent opposite that of His Serene Highness until the ninety pieces of heavy ordinance, which had been brought from the armoury, and the arequebusiers had fired. After this was done, Archduke Ferdinand with the above-mentioned princely personages went on foot half way between the two tents in order to greet his beloved promised bride by word of mouth as well as the royal personages who had accompanied her. The Count von Hohenembs welcomed the mother of the bride in the Italian language and Herr Caspar Baron von Wolkenstein made reply and gave thanks.
    Thereupon the entry began. At the head were the whole of the mounted troops and the servitors together with the trumpeters and the army drummers, then followed the counts, squires and nobility, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, both Margraves of Baden and Burgau, Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria, the Prince of Mantua, the Cardinal of Austria, then Archduke Ferdinand. On his right rode the Imperial Envoy, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, on his left Archduke Carl of Austria. Then followed the betrothed Princess with her mother, and a stately retinue of ladies-in-waiting in elegant gilt litters, and carriages on springs. On either side stood the aforesaid soldiery. They rode through three large triumphal arches, fashioned of woodwork and cloth. The first was in front of the Gateway of St. George, where stood eight men holding the coat of arms of the hereditary lands of His Serene Highness, and Latin verses, celebrating the country’s joy at the arrival of their future mistress. The second arch was near the Gate of the Outer City: it was ornamented with an artificial weir and four springing fountains. The third was in the town in the square in front of the Tyrol Chamber with the golden roof. Hereon stood four heroes, and above them twenty-eight boys in gilt clothing with silver bells, and yet above these a band. As soon as the procession had dismounted from the horses, litters and coaches, it wended its way towards the new Imperial Cathedral. There in front of the open church door the Archduke was united with the promised bride by the aforesaid Bishop in canonical robes. The trumpeters blew a joyous blast and vespers were said. The upper church in which stood all the princely wedding guests, was hung with golden ornaments and the whole building with beauteous Dutch tapestries. Hereafter, the sixteen royal wedding guests partook of the evening meal at a table in the golden room. The counts, squires and noblemen, and all the Court and ordinary attendants were served in the inns.
    After the feast, followed dances which were first led by the Archduke Ferdinand, then by the Imperial Envoy and so on according to precedence. Archduke Carl and the Prince of Mantua led the bride as ushers. His Serene Highness and both Margraves danced ahead with torches in their hands. On the15th day of May an elegant and princely joust took place in the lists. All the royal personages, with the exception of the Cardinal appeared in brave raiment and broke their spears on a figure in the presentment of a stag. Archduke Ferdinand received the first prize because he broke the most spears. Although Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria had a fall from his horse, it all passed without mishap, thanks be to God.
    On the 16th day of May, there was held a magnificent tourney on foot in which once more the royal personages and others of eminence took part. They brought into the lists a huge Trojan horse and a castle, together with a fortress made of wood; this which they called the town of Louvain, they attacked and stormed.
    On the 17th day of May, there was a splendid chamois hunt above Innsbruck near Zirl on the St. Martin’s Rock to which came all the royal personages. On the same evening there was held in the Court Garden an exceeding fine artificial display of fireworks with the firing of several large pieces and shooting muskets and fire bullets.
    On the 18th day of May, Archduke Carl, the Duke of Bavaria, the Margrave of Baden, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, together with their princely spouses, ladies-in-waiting and other members of the Court of Innsbruck went by water on their way to Munich.
    So this princely bridal home-coming and nuptials, thanks be to God, passed in beautiful weather, with goodly peace, unity and concord.
    The old Duchess of Mantua with her son, the Prince, are still in Innsbruck.

50. Festival of the Circumcision in Constantinople
unknown
        August 1582
            background: Festivities in Constantinople on the Circumcision of Mehemed, son of the Sultan Murad.
    The festivities were fixed for the 2nd day of June 1582, on which day the ceremony in Seraglio which had lasted eight days, came to an end. There the gifts of the Sultanas and other great ladies of the kingdom were presented to the Prince. These gifts consisted of horses, richly-adorned slaves, jewels, garments, and such like. In addition to this, fireworks were burnt day and night for a whole week.
    On the day named, the 2nd day of June, at the Sultan’s command, there assembled in the great Hippodrome all the Pashas, Viziers and the Beglerbeghs of Greece and Anatolia, the Aga of the Janissaries, the Capudan Pasha and other great men of the Realm, together with all the Janissaries. The wax torches destined for the ceremony were about two and a half yards in height and of most unusual thickness. These torches were richly decorated with flowers, gold and silver, and are therefore very heavy. From the Hippodrome the whole gathering proceeded to the Sultan’s Palace. First strode the Khan and other great personages of the Sublime Porte in robes richly embroidered in gold. Then there appeared Mehemed, the son of the great Sultan, on a horse beautifully caparisoned with jewels. The head harness was set with diamonds and a double row of pearls of immense value.
    The youth, who was about sixteen years old, was clad in a richly embroidered coat of green satin. He has an elongated face, pale of colour, his eyes are black and have a serious expression. He greeted the people with lofty gesture. Behind the Prince came six horses, led with halters, with silken saddle clothes, richly embroidered with gold. The ceremonial procession arrived in the Seraglio about the hour of midday. There in accordance with the customs of the country, was made loudly resounding music, on kettledrums, trumpets and other instruments. Then the actual festivities began. There appeared one hundred men with staves, at the end of which were bladders filled with air. They were led by a man who rode a small donkey. With these bladders they struck at the inquisitive assembly in order to drive them off. Then came one hundred Janissaries who had been chosen to guard the seats in the Hippodrome which were destined for the foreign ambassadors. On the first day of the festivities, tight-rope dancers showed their tricks, which they performed with quite amazing skill. Others, again, turned somersaults, which it is impossible either to comprehend or to describe. Also several very skilled spear throwers exhibited their accomplishments for admiration. At night fall an illumination was arranged and this lasted until morning. Four castles filled with fireworks were lighted on the square of the Hippodrome and presented a truly entertaining sight. On the second day there were shown some other clever feats by the tight-rope dancers. There appeared among others a man who allowed a heavy block of marble, on which six men rained blows with hammers, to be placed across his naked belly. Another climbed a very high column placed on a pyramid and performed daring tricks thereon. This man was granted his freedom by His Majesty, and received moreover a gold embroidered robe and a gift of twenty piastres daily for his lifetime. Other jugglers allowed horseshoes to be nailed to their heads. On this day began also the presentation of the gifts from the Great of the Realm and the foreign Ambassadors, which continued day by day. particularly to be mentioned is the Persian Ambassador, who altogether made a brave show. He had arrived with a retinue of two hundred sumptuously clad fellows and witnessed the display in the circus from a box which had been specially erected for him. From behind the grille on their stand, the Chief Sultanas were also able to enjoy the spectacle. In the evening two wooden castled filled with fireworks were set ablaze.
    On the third day various artificially prepared objects were exhibited, among them about three hundred large figures of animals, made of sugar. This lasted until midday, thereafter gifts were presented to all the Ambassadors who had been invited by His Majesty. The Hippodrome was sprinkled by twenty water waggons. A juggler performed there, he hit himself in the face with a stone with all his strength without any harm resulting therefrom. Another executed bold somersaults and was masked. Both were presented with gifts from His Majesty. The Sultan ordered seven thousand flat cakes made out of cooked rice to be brought, also six thousand large loaves of bread and great quantities of mutton. When all this was spread upon the ground, all the poor came rushing in the greatest haste to get hold of the food, and this proved a very entertaining sight. Thereafter was held a hunt of Hungarian boars. In the evening there were once more illuminations and fireworks.
    On the fourth day, other jugglers disported themselves on the aforementioned pyramid on which they performed tricks. On this day the different craftsmen paid homage to the Sultan, among them the weavers of golden shawls worn by the women here on their heads. Then followed three hundred youths from twelve to sixteen in age, in robes worked with gold, who sang songs in praise of the Sultan and his son. This performance pleased the Sultan so much that he gave them a bag with one thousand sequins and ordered them to come to him again the next day. Then there was shown in the Hippodrome a carriage which moved by itself, whilst another to which there were harnessed a horse and a donkey, went up in the air on a tight rope. After this once more gifts of great value were presented. In the evening there took place a feeding of the populace, and four thousand rice cakes, six thousand loaves of bread, and twenty roasted oxen were served on large tables.
    On the fifth day the workers of the Arsenal were entertained. They were given six hundred oxen, a thousand sheep and an immense amount of rice soup. Each worker loaded himself with his potions and betook himself home with it. In the evening there took place the feeding of the populace with bread, mutton and rice. Then came yet another boar hunt and finally illuminations and fireworks.
    On the sixth day there were only entertainments for the people, illuminations and fireworks.
    On the seventh day five thousand Janissaries were regaled in the Hippodrome, together with their Aga. They ate off carpets in six great large galley tents. In the evening there was a feeding of the people and fireworks.

Then came sixty riders in sumptuously ornamented yellow satin robes with breast-plates and morions, who held combat with a hundred and fifty richly attired foot soldiers armed with staves. Then two wooden castles were brought in, in one of which were Christian slaves, who were armed with arquebuses and morions. They also had drums, such as we use. These two castles were stormed the while numerous shots were fired. After this there was a combat between Turkish and Persian warriors and at the finish many riders were thrown out of the saddle with halberd strokes. The Emperor and Ali Pasha were pleased with this spectacle. In the evening the populace was fed again and fireworks were burned.
    On the ninth day the Venetian Ambassador handed over to the Grand Seignior a hundred and fifty gifts from the Venetian Rulers. Among them were four gold embroidered robes and many silken ones. A race with riderless horses was arranged. A juggler danced on a very high platform. He fell from it and was killed. Then a Fox, boar and hare hunt took place. In the evening the people again received victuals and splendid fireworks were burnt which lasted until daylight. The earlier displays were shorter.
    On the tenth day four thousand Spahis with their Aga were entertained. Everything proceeded as at the feast given to the Janissaries, and the Spahis made music. In the evening: feasting of the populace and fireworks.
    On the eleventh day came all their singers, who may be described as mad. They ranged themselves in the market place where the Sultan was, and it was said that they were praying to God for the life of the Sultan. But their method of praying is peculiar and laughable. In the evening fireworks. On this day was seen in the Hippodrome a circus rider, who stood on a horse that was in full gallop. He also sprang from the ground to the galloping horse with great skill. Then the horse stood still and the man sprang on to its back and remained standing there. The horse stood as motionless as though carved in wood. In the evening there was again food for the populace, likewise fireworks. Many loaves of bread were flung among the people from the windows of the palace. The Sultan’s son threw sequins, aspri, and other coins, six thousand sequins’ worth in all, from a window and sixty silver dishes besides. Until 4 o’clock of the morning gorgeous fireworks were burned.
    On the twelfth day the Grand Master of the Artillery was entertained with three thousand gunners. This was carried out in a way like unto that used for the Janissaries and the Spahis. Then there appeared in the Hippodrome a hundred richly dressed horsemen, who fought in Spanish armour. Later they shot with arrows at a disk fastened to a very high pole. They showed great prowess. In the evening the populace was regaled and two galleys and three castles which had been filled with fireworks were burned.
    On the thirteenth day one hundred and seventy richly robed men of the Spinners’ Guild rendered homage to the Sultan. Then fifty mounted archers gave an exhibition. After the feeding of the populace an artificial mountain, erected by the slaves of the Capudan Pasha, in which fireworks were hidden, was set alight. This was not successful. On the other hand, other pieces, such as a giant dressed as a Jew, a dragon, four castles and a ruin made a pleasing spectacle.

Then followed the remaining Periotes and twelve youths who executed dances to the accompaniment of loud music. His Majesty sent them embroidered kerchiefs and four thousand aspri. Then one hundred and fifty armourers did homage, followed by the goldsmiths, then one hundred and fifty cutlers and two hundred tinsmiths. And then followed one after another various guilds of the town with their beautiful and rare handiwork. The master remembered them all with presents of gold. As the populace was being fed that day, the onrush of the poor was so great that more than a half of the food was mangled, and the rest so badly spoiled that not even the dogs would touch it.

51. Report from India

            background: Short report which arrived in a letter of the Governor Tellez of Meneses of March last in the year 1581, via the land route.
    One of the mightiest Kings of Oriental India, a neighbour of Portuguese territory, is anxious to become a Christian, as may be learned from letters which arrived from his lands during two consecutive years. It may be regarded as certain that he will now take this step very shortly.
    The Raschu, a very mighty and powerful King, has appropriated nearly the whole kingdom of Ceylon, and laid siege to it for twenty months with a powerful army. The assistance afforded by the Portuguese cost them near on three times one hundred thousand cross ducats and many warriors. But they finally beat the enemy on the day of our dear Lord, the 17th day of February of the year 1581, and a great number of their best fighters fell. They also took from him the larger part of his cannon and other war equipment.
    The King of Dacha, whose kingdom is situate upon the island of Sumatra, has through good luck and assistance gained so considerably in power and reputation that he made the seas unsafe and hoped without help to usurp the power of India. For several years he pursued this plan and His Majesty had decided to send a powerful Armada from Portugal. But this was rendered unnecessary since our Lord God had ordained that the King of Dacha should leave this world through the portals of death. Thereupon great quarrels broke out there and the Governor of India hopes to be able to wage war on this country, which enterprise he will yet undertake within a year.
    The Hidalcar, King of Balayato and lord of the mainland round the town of Goa, died a short while ago. Such disagreements there were between his Captains that the one throttled the other. Thereupon the lord so ordained it that this kingdom has fallen into the hands of a Moor of royal blood, who was brought up in Goa among the Portuguese and received a yearly allowance from them. He has promised to be a good friend and neighbour and to keep free all the harbours, which bring in yearly eight times a hundred thousand ducats, also to grant considerable privileges. A Captain has sailed along the northern coast with ten ships and has ascertained that at Dabul there is a fort belonging to Hidalcar and many ships. Although the enemy hoped to obtain assistance from his own people on land, the Commander, in spite of resistance, pressed them so hard that he killed most of their fighters and took away ten ships without their getting any help.
