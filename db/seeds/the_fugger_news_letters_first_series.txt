3-6. Execution of Count Egmont and Count Horn in Brussels
        unknown
        4 June 1499
    On the 4th June of this year 1568, Count Egmont and Count Horn were taken on a special conveyance from Ghent to Brussels. They were accompanied by twelve troops of Spaniards on foot and several hundreds on horseback. When Count Egmont beheld the town of Brussels, he said: “I am in good hopes that the Duke of Alba will of his mercy allow me to sup with my spouse and my children this night." They had been with him of late and had brought him consolation. But as soon as they entered the town, (it was at three o’clock in the afternoon,) they were taken to the King’s Bread-House, which stands in the market-place opposite the Town Hall, and thereupon Count Egmont said: “Now I have lost all hope!” The same evening at seven o’clock, their sentence was read out to the two counts, thereupon Egmont on that evening and during the night oft repeated: That the wrongs he had committed against His Majesty might graciously be forgiven him and his life spared in return for the services he had rendered; that he should be punished with lifelong imprisonment and be treated not as a count, but as a poor nobleman. The King should be implored thus on his behalf. The Grand Prior likewise, it is rumoured, has thrown himself on his knees before the carriage of the Duke, but it has availed him nothing. The Duke is reported to have said that the sentence of both gentlemen is to be carried out. Therefore the Bishop of Ypres has been sent to them as Confessor, and, in addition to him, the Duke’s Chaplain and a Spanish priest. These remained with them until their death. In the morning a stand, which is called here a scaffold, was erected in the market-place, and on either side a pole with an iron point was nailed thereto. The said scaffold was draped with black cloth and two black cushions were laid upon it. The market-place was guarded by the twenty troops which had come from Ghent and by ten from Brussels. At eleven o’clock Count Egmont was first brought from the King’s Bread-House to the market-place. He was unbound and accompanied by the Bishop of Ypres and the two Spanish priests and the Maistre de Camp. He was attired in a black velvet doublet, cut low at the neck, wide black velvet breeches, and brodequins, or white Spanish boots. Over this he wore a red damask night-robe, and an ordinary black cloak, both edged with gold braid. He also wore a hat with black and white plumes thereon. He walked from the said Bread-House to the scaffold. He carried his cloak over his shoulder and had his hands crossed upon his breast. And so he walked in orderly fashion and with a proud face as he had formerly been wont to go to the Council.
    He carried himself bravely, though his face looked melancholy and afflicted. He held his cloak before his mouth, thrown over his shoulder, and looked around him; then he laid it aside, composed himself for death, and was about to unrobe himself. The Maistre de Camp said to him: “Oh, there is no haste, take time for reflection. Time and to spare will be given to you and this vouchsafed right willingly." Thereupon he slung the cloak once more round his shoulders and again looked around him, but without saying a word or making a sign. Only his right hand he stretched out from under the cloak and gazed upon it fixedly. Therefore the Bishop of Ypres addressed him in these words: “Sir, do not take thought now of any worldly matters, but bethink yourself of the salvation of your soul." At that he asked: Whether the salvation of his soul could prevent him thinking of his wife and his children? The Bishop answered: “Nay, since our Lord Himself, as He hung upon the Cross for the remission of our sins, committed His mother to the care of John." Thereupon the Court made reply: “Then there is naught that roubles my heart or lies heavy on my conscience." With these words he put down his hat, laid aside his cloak, likewise his night-robe. The Maistre de Camp once more bade him not to hurry, but the Count made answer that, as it was ordained he must die, he wished to do so. He knelt down with the Bishop and spoke privately with him for the space of two paternosters. Thereupon he himself motioned him aside with his hand, lifted a gilt cross from where it lay on the scaffold, and knelt before it. Likewise he pulled the white cap or bandage which he had on his head over his eyes, and thus remained kneeling for some time while the executioner made ready. Meanwhile the Bishop inquired of him whether he would permit his bandage to be made tight. “Nay,” he replied, “I will die right valiantly and deport myself in seemly fashion." Thereupon the executioner carried out his appointed task with the sword. Immediately this was done the two Spanish priests bore away the dead body and the head, and placed them under a black cloth at the side of the scaffold. They then fetched Count Horn from the Bread-House. He also was unfettered, and when he stepped out upon the market-place he doffed his hat and bade the soldiers on both sides good-day in the Spanish tongue.These did likewise. Then he went bravely, bareheaded, hat in hand, to the scaffold. He wore his usual garments, a doublet of white linen and laced black velvet breeches, and thereover a cloak. As soon as he mounted the scaffold he spoke to all and sundry, saying how much it grieved him that he had so acted against the King and not served him better. He craved the pardon of His Majesty and of whomsoever he should have offended. This same he was willing to grant to all. He begged that every one should say a paternoster for him. Thereupon he fell on his knees with the Bishop and thus remained the space of two paternosters, or thereabouts. The hat he held in his hands all the time. Then he arose once more, thanked everybody in a strong and manly voice, and made obeisance to all the soldiers who did likewise. Thereupon he laid aside his cloak and knelt down unbound. After this the executioner did as he was ordered. When both gentlemen had been executed, their heads were placed on two iron spikes where they remained till the afternoon at three. But the corpses were guarded by six monks, who, clad in grey, and as is the custom here, bury the dead. The bodies were unrobed under a linen cloth that was spread over them and each was laid in a special chest, in which they remained for about an hour upon the scaffold. Thereafter, they, as well as the heads, were carried in a four-cornered separate little box to the Church of St. Gudule. There the heads were sewn to the bodies and Count Egmont transported to St. Claire, and Count Horn to another convent. Thereafter Egmont was embalmed and buried in his own domain at Gottegem, and Horn likewise at Weert.

6-7. The Passing Away of Don Carlos
        Madrid
        24 July 1568
    The Prince of Spain during his imprisonment, apart from a few times, has not wished to touch food. Nevertheless he had been persuaded to give up such a whim. But when the hot days began he waxed impatient on account of his incarceration and behaved in unseemly fashion. It is said that he caused his room to be deluged with water and oft walked barefoot in it. About ten days ago, for several days—some have it as many as six—he would partake of nothing but fruit and drink great quantities of cold water. By means of this he caused his digestion and his whole body to become greatly discomforted.When after this he wished to take food once more, he was no longer able to retain it and was taken so ill in the forenoon that he passed away last night at one. But he had a good Christian end and begged the King’s forgiveness for all that he had done and desired to do against him. This, verily, is unpleasant tidings for the country. It is said that the King has neither seen him in his illness nor wished to go to him, neither has the Queen nor the Princess. The Prince will be buried to-morrow on the day of San Jaime in San Domingo Real. May God grant his soul eternal rest. It is also averred that he sent a request to the King, his father, that he should graciously remember his servitors and pay his debts, which it is expected His Majesty will do.

7-8. The Death of Queen Elizabeth of Spain
        Madrid
        5 October 1568
    I have reported to Your Serene Highness that the Queen of Spain is pregnant once more. Because last year nothing came of her pregnancy, many people have on this occasion cherished doubts likewise. Several women have presented her with jewels and given her flower-water to drink in order that she might the sooner conceive and retain what had been vouchsafed to her. Others say that in the past year when she miscarried, she, according to the reported custom in France, did not cleanse herself properly that she might again soon become pregnant. Be that as it may, Her Majesty hath been weakened mightily by long swoons. Some have it that she is half paralysed and cannot use one arm and one thigh as easily as formerly. Therefore the leeches hold a grave opinion of her illness, and it has been said that she could not live loner than four or five months. These swoons have affected Her Majesty more and more, so that since the Feast of St. Michael she has lain mostly abed. On the second day of this month the physicians gave her two purgatives and bled her. That night Her Majesty, who was very weak, confirmed her former Will, and early in the morning received Extreme Unction. She is said to have commended her daughter to the care of the King, and she sent once more for the Ambassador of France. Him she ordered to tell the King, her brother, and the Queen, her mother, that she besought them to continue and keep the friendship with the King of Spain. If they would do so, God would bestow upon them the help of the King of Spain. They say that the King went to her with frequency and was much affected at her great weakness. On that day, about ten o’clock in the forenoon, the pains are said to have become very grievous until she gave birth to a young Prince. Some assure us that he came alive from the womb of his mother and received baptism, others that he was taken from her dead and in pieces, as he could not have been older than five months. In order to be exact, it must be said that she is only supposed to have become pregnant in last May when she was with the King in Aranjuez. After she had suffered from heavy swooning and great weakness, God our Lord called her unto Him, about two hours after the birth of the child at noon. She is said to have passed away in a most Christian manner. May Our Lord God give her eternal peace. The King has shown great sorrow on account of this and has withdrawn himself to San Geronimo, the convent outside the city. In 1558 we lost here in Spain the Emperor Charles and two Queens. In this year ’68 we have lost two Princes of Spain and the Queen. May God turn His wrath away from this land!
    Rumour already secretly betroths our King to the eldest daughter of His Imperial majesty and adds thereto that if His Majesty is not minded to wed a fourth time, then His Majesty will bespeak the eldest Infanta for Archduke Rudolf.
    Then His Highness would remain here, renouncing all his concerns abroad, in order to become, after the demise of His Majesty, King of Spain. It is also affirmed that His Majesty wishes to betroth the Archduke Ernst to the youngest Infanta and to give them Flanders as a dowry. These are the views commonly held. What, however, will happen, time alone will disclose.
    According to my opinion His Majesty will not omit to marry again.

8-9. Piracy of the English
        Seville
        21 January 1569
    There have arrived several English letters from Vigo in Galicia, wherein is written as follows: “In the past year an Englishman with eight well-equipped ships has sailed from England to Guinea into the sea territory of the King of Portugal. After he had exchanged his wares for one thousand five hundred negroes, he has made his way with them to New Spain. In order that he might do this without opposition and in a manner to suit himself, he has occupied a small island called San Juan de Lua near Vera Cruz, where the Spanish fleet was wont to load and unload and by which the Spanish ships must always pass. There he has blocked the water with ships and guns so that the Spanish fleet of thirty ships, which arrived there shortly after him, was unable to get into the harbour of Vera Cruz without his permission. The Spanish General had perforce to make a pact with the said Englishman, that he might sell his negroes freely and take away the money thus gained. A written contract was drawn up as to this, and they delivered unto each other twelve hostages. Several days after the Spanish General had come into the harbour of Vera Cruz, either because he held the contract unfair or out of anger at the overbearing demeanour of the Englishman, he broke the treaty, if not openly and by word of mouth, yet secretly by deed. At his instigation, seven old ships were stealthily set alight and driven from out of the harbour among the English ships. In this manner it was desired to burn all the English ships and that the captains thereof might perish. But when the Englishman espied this and realized the deceit practised upon him, he became wrathful and has, with his other ships, thus pressed the Spanish fleet that four of their ships were sent to the bottom. But as his own vessels had suffered no little stress, he made his way homewards with the twelve Spanish hostages. But a bad storm scattered his fleet and he alone reached Vigo with one vessel, badly buffeted and suffering for lack of food. He could not have remained three days longer on the water. There he made provision of all that was needful and set sail for England. It is not known where the other ships have remained or what has befallen them.”

10. Auto de fé in Seville
        Seville
        13 May 1569
    The auto de fé of which I have already written took place here to-day. Seventy persons were brought forth, of which have been burned two Burgundians, one Frenchman and one Dutchman. The others were for the most part Spanish rabble of poor mien, namely blasphemers of the name of God, and such as had been married twice or more. There were also among them such as did not hold fornication as sin. Likewise were there some of Jewish and Mohammedan faith.

10. The Razing of the Cuilembourg House in Brussels
        unknown
        1569
    In Brussels, in the middle of the site where formerly there stood the mansion of the Count de Cuilembourg, which has been razed to the ground, there now has been erected a large pillar of grey stones and the following inscription in Spanish, French, Latin and Italian engraved on the four sides thereof: “In the reign of Philip II, the Catholic, King of Spain, it has been decided in his Netherland Provinces, under the regency of Ferdinand Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, that the palace of the Count de Builembourg shall be levelled to the ground, in order to obliterate the very memory of the conspiracies against the Roman Catholic Faith, the King’s Majesty, and against the Provinces themselves, which oft have been hatched therein. In the year of Grace 1568 on the 9th day of June.”

10. Unrest among the Miners in Schwaz
        Augsburg
        20 December 1569
    In Schwaz it is rumoured that the miners are about to rise on account of the Religion which the Archduke intends to observe in his domain according to his own pleasure. That doth not please the overseers of the mines and they needs must incite the other poor simpletons to rebel. This can, however, soon be prevented by removing the foremen or bidding them follow the customs of the land in matters of religious observance and to keep their mouths tight shut. The others are to work or pray, whether they wish it or not, and therefore may well be kept within bounds.

11. Malversation of the Civic Treasurer in Antwerp
        Antwerp
        26  August 1570
    In the past days the people of this town have stormed the house of their late Treasurer, Christoph Braun, and have taken away all his account books and documents. Fourteen sergeants were left to guard him. The sergeants were sitting at their midday repast having first carefully locked the chief portal. Braun arose in order to pass water. He betook himself into the kitchen which has a secret passage to the cellar. Thus he escaped into the street and made himself scarce. Who opened the cellar door to him is not apparent. All his domestics have been taken prisoner and the said Braun has been summoned to give himself up under pain of death. It is also forbidden to any one to grant him shelter. The town will pay one thousand Rhenish guilders to whoever notifies his whereabouts. He is said to owe the town over and above one hundred and fifty thousand guilders.

        unknown
background: List of the presents with which the Royal Princess of France has been honoured by His Majesty, his Lady Mother and his brethren.
    The King of France caused to be given:
    To his Bride, the said Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of His Imperial Majesty:

    Moreover, a gift is expected to be made by the King to the Empress, to take the form of a prayer book in gorgeous binding with a small piece of the true Holy Cross.

13-14. Insolvencies at the Exchange at Antwerp
        Antwerp
        9 December 1570
    Here the Genoese have arranged a competition at the Exchange and because of it two Genoese houses have gone bankrupt this week: they are Giovanni Grimaldi and then Pedro Francesco et Pedro Christophoro Spinola, who have behind them all the Germans here. It has always been regarded as a well-established business, and has long traded in this town. The creditors keep of good cheer. It is, however, to be feared that it may be with this as with other bankruptcies. At first there is ever enough on hand, but in the end no one can obtain anything. The Spinola did show their books to the creditors, but would not deliver them, saying that their agent in Spain is still in a good position. They assert that they are not in difficulties on this account, and also that this came upon them unexpectedly. Therewith the creditors have to be content for the nonce. But they have had the books sealed up and have delivered them to a notary for custody. This bankruptcy has put an end to credit among the Genoese. Within the space of a few years many bankruptcies have taken place, but I have never seen such excitement on the Exchange as there is regarding this. They are owing a large amount, but no one knows how much, for their books have not as yet been balanced. Grimaldi are said to be indebted for 80,000 ducats.
    It will probably not end with these two, but they will drag down others of their nation with them.
    Herewith your Honour has a list of the Genoese who have become insolvent at Cambray, where these days is held the Besançon payment. This may truly be called a competition. Time will show which of these scoundrels wins the booty, and perhaps the gallows will be their summer dwelling.
    The following bankruptcies are reported in letters from Lyons of the 29th day of November: Nicolo Giustiniani & Stefano Rizierola, Tomaso Spinola, fu de Niro, Giovanni Antonio & Girolamo Grimaldi, Jacopo Fiesco & Antonio Lescaro di Messina, Antonio & Tommaso de Franchi di Palermo. Bills have been protested—to Giovanni Francesco & Antonio Fornari di Genova, 11,000 scudi and Gentili di Napoli, for the same amount.

14. War against the Moors
        Madrid
        31 January 1571
    After the Moors have all been driven out of the Kingdom of Granada and distributed over the whole of Spain, it is taken for granted that this war has now been brought to an end. Now, however, in many localities where the Moors have been apportioned, there have appeared maladies, like Modora and Petchia fever. Complaints are made that the Moors, who have suffered so much hunger and destitution, have brought the said diseases with them. In this cold winter, which in December and January has been the severest for many years, these illnesses have taken root and it is to be feared that new ones may develop with the coming of the summer heat.

14-17. The Battle of Lepanto
unknown
        8 October 1571
        background: Copy of a News-Letter from the Christian Armada,
    As soon as the Christian  Armada arrived at 6 o’clock in the evening in the little channel of Cephalonia, it was at once espied by the crafty Turkish Armada, which lay in the Gulf of Lepanto. This is snot to be wondered at, for the pirate Caragoggia offered the Turkish commander to inspect the Christian Armada and to count its ships, which he achieved with such skill that he suffered no damaged thereby. Perhaps he was over hasty in this or prevented by some unknown cause from giving the correct number of our galleys. Thereupon, the wind being very favourable, the Turkish Commander began preparations for battle with great joy, and took on board twelve thousand men over and above the soldiery he had in the Armada. Thus, thanks to divine Providence and Fate, he robbed himself of an advantage, contrary to all usage of sea warfare. Don Juan of Austria also set sail with his Armada and sent ahead several galleys to inspect the enemy. Moreover, he sent forth six galleons from the harbour. These reported that the Turkish Armada was already nearing, and not far from Cephalonia. Thereupon Don Juan attired himself in a light suit of armour and boarded a small ship, called a frigate. Holding a crucifix in his hand, he visited one galley after the other, appointing to each its proper place in the battle and exhorting the crew to fight valiantly against the arch-enemy of the Christian Faith. Not he, but Christ, who had died for us upon the Cross, was the Father of all, and the Patron of this Armada, and he hoped that they would find help and sustenance in His mercy. Thereupon the whole soldiery sent forth great shouts of jubilation and forthwith placed themselves in battle formation. Whereafter the above mentioned Don Juan of Austria again entered his galley and went out to meet the Turkish Armada. Then the sea became quite still and the galleasses, which had sailed ahead, opened with heavy fire which brought great damage and terror to the Turks, causing them to cry: “Maom, Maom!” which means in their language “Big ships, big ships with big cannon!”  Thus the Turkish Armada, which had been sailing ship to ship in half-moon formation, fell into disorder and was split into three parts. The first and largest part attacked the left wing of the Christian Armada, the second the centre and the third the right wing, which was led by Don Andreas Doria, who had lost almost all his fighters on ten of his galleys at the outset of the fight, although they had put up a most valiant and brave defence. It would have fared ill with him had not several galleys from the centre squadron come to his rescue, which help instilled fresh courage into his men, so that they forced the enemy again to withdraw. The left wing also put up a brave and gallant fight, but it also would have been in a sorry plight had not the rear, led by the Marques de Santa Cruz, come to relieve it, attacking the enemy in such fashion that the scales of victory turned completely in our favour. There also sprang up a wind to our assistance. In the smoke of battle Uluch Ali escaped. It is unknown whether he has fled to Africa or to the Gulf of Lepanto. Of forty of the principal galleys, of which we captured twenty-nine, one only was he able to save. Our general, Don Juan of Austria—whose achievements I should have reported first of all—rammed with his galley that of the Turkish commander, finally captured it, cut off the head of the Turkish pasha with his own hand and placed it at the end of a spear of his own galley. The galley of Don Vittorio Colonna was attacked by two Turkish ones, fore and amidships, but he defended himself valiantly and was finally rescued, and thus was victorious. The Venetian Chief, Venier by name, who is seventy years of age, appeared, clad in light armour, on his own galley, at the head of all and fought right valiantly alongside his men, so that he captured Ali Pasha and his vessel. Don Barbarigo also carried himself like a true knight in this battle. An arrow pierced his right eye and he died in great pain and greatly to the sorrow of those near to him.
    In this battle Don Quirin and Don Andrea Doria, Don Ascanio della Corina, Signor Fabio Serbelon, Don Pompeo Colonna, Don Prospero Colonna and Orsini with their attendant knights, Spaniards and Italians both, fought with such bravery that it cannot be fittingly recounted in so scant a space. The battle began on the 7th day of this month, two hours after daybreak, and within five hours the Christians had achieved victory with the help of the Lord. Almost all the Turkish nobles and nearly eighteen thousand men were killed, ten thousand taken prisoner, and fifteen thousand Christians, who had been slaves on the Turkish galleys, were set free. These latter caused the Turks much harm when the battle began. On several galleys there were also found a large number of Sultanas and Zechines and on Caragoggia’s galley a beautiful young woman, a Christian. She was daintily and richly attired and her neck adorned with large pearls and other precious stones and jewels. She offered to buy her release with 60,000 ducats.
    As far as can be gathered in all haste, on our side twenty Venetian noblemen and several thousand men lost their lives. One hundred Turkish galleys are captured, sixty have been sent to the bottom. Plans are being concerted to take the greatest advantage from this victory and to pursue Uluch Ali, who has made his escape. Through God’s special grace the generals and colonels are all of one mind and well satisfied with each other.
    Praise and glory be to God Almighty and His Blessed Mother in all Eternity. Amen.

17. War against the Moors
        Seville
        18 November 1571
    Twenty-four galleys have arrived here, laden with Moors. These are to be distributed in all parts, as will also be done elsewhere. In this wise will Spaniards become more tainted and intermixed with Moors than heretofore. Thus they and the Jews shall be the noblest and strongest races, for they multiply like royal rabbits.

17. Atrocities in Russia
        Moscow 
        1572
            background: News-Letter
    The only fresh news I have to report at this time is that the Muscovite himself ravages and despoils his own land and nation. The folk are pitilessly and cruelly killed in their thousands in all towns and many villages. They freeze to death and perish by violent means. Corn, cattle, and all else which is needed for man’s sustenance is burnt, corn is scattered in the street and the fields and altogether much wanton damage is wrought.

18. St. Bartholomew’s Eve
        Amsterdam
        30 August 1572
    Of the extraordinary happenings which took place in Paris a few days ago, Your Honour, without doubt, will already have heard through other channels. If not, then be it made known to you that the Admiral of France was on his way on horseback to Court on the 22nd day of this month. As he was reading a letter in the street, a musket was fired at him from a window. He was but hit in the arm, yet stood in danger of his life. Whereupon it is said that the King evinced great zeal to probe into this matter. With this the Admiral did not rest content, but is reported to have said, he well knew who was behind this, and would take revenge, were he to shed royal blood. So when the King’s brother, the Duke of Anjou, and the Guises and others heard of this, they decided to make the first move and speedily to dispose of the whole matter. On the night of the 23rd day of this month they broke into the Admiral’s house, murdered him in his bed, and then threw him out of the window. The same day they did likewise unto all his kin, upon whom they could lay their hands. It is said that thirty people were thus murdered, among them the most noble of his following, and also Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, the Marquis de Retz, the King’s bastard brother, and others. This has been likened unto Sicilian Vespers, by which the Huguenots and the Gueux of this country had their wings well trimmed. The Admiral has reaped just payment. We hear that the Prince and his retinue are being watchful that no such fate befall them. Truly, potentates do not permit themselves to be trifled with, and whosoever is so blind that he cannot see this learns it later to his sorrow. Since the Admiral, as has been reported, has now been put out of the way, it is to be supposed that all his scheming plots and secrets will be brought to the light of day. This may in time cause great uproar, as it is more than probable that many a one at present regarded as harmless was party to this game.

19. The Driving Forth of the Jews From Vienna
        Vienna
        15 December 1572
    His Imperial Majesty has recently issued here a general decree, which has also been posted in all parts, that all Jews who have until this day been domiciled in His Majesty’s lands, greatly to the detriment of the inhabitants thereof, are to depart with their kith and kin, between now and the coming Palm Sunday. By this decree also, all and sundry privileges, even those bestowed before His Majesty’s time, are annulled and withdrawn.

19-20. Disturbances caused by Students in Paris
        Paris
        12 February 1573
    On the 5th day of February, being the first Sunday in Lent, the Queen Mother of France drove with her daughter, the Queen of Navarre, and other Princes and Attendants of the Court, about vesper time to the College of Jesuits to hear the reading of vespers. She was escorted by M. de Lorraine, M. de Bourbon and three Cardinals driving and on horseback. The students of Paris, who are wont to indulge in scuffles with the servants of the Court, had collected in bands outside the College, where they began quarrelling and brawling with the muleteers. When the courtiers and the Princes came out of the College and were about to bestride their horses and enter their coaches, the students attacked them with rapiers and cudgels, surrounded the carriages with great turbulence, thrust their hands into the bosom of the Queen of Navarre and mockingly stroked her plumes. The Cardinal de Lorraine they pushed into the deepest hole in the deepest mud. The aged Queen they not only assaulted with unsheathed foils, but also insulted in obscene, foul and lewd terms, which it would be shameful to repeat. The reason thereof had not been imparted to me, neither what devilry drove them unto such disorderly conduct.
    The King, with just cause, has been very greatly incensed thereat and has had it announced on the 9th day of February that any student is forbidden, on pain of death, to show his face in the streets. Desiring to see with his own eyes whether the students were obeying his command, he rode on that same day on horseback, clad in armour and his face hidden by a mask, surrounded by a few servants into that part of the town where the students live, which is known as La Universite. Mercifully nothing occurred, for those who instigated the disturbances kept wisely at home. The King has commanded the authorities to investigate the affair and to throw the culprits into the Tower. Many who left their lodgings at night were cast into the common prison. Sentence has not yet been passed on them.

20-21. Famine in France
        Paris
        4 June 1573
    The land this year has not been tilled in many places and people have been ruined to such an extent by the soldiery that they now perish from hunger and die. One who has been this with his own eyes in many places, informs me that the people cut the unripe corn from the tilled fields and eat it. Altogether there is said to be great misery and poverty. About three thousand persons thus reduced to destitution came before the King at Fontainebleau; and followed His Majesty so that he might cause bread to be distributed among them. Riots were feared here, for in recent days corn has become dearer by one half. Precautions were therefore taken and those who had corn stored away were compelled to bring part of it to the market. Thus it was brought to pass that what cost in the forenoon twenty-one and twenty-two was offered in the afternoon for seventeen. On the other hand it is reported that the rabble is again preparing to loot and that this time it is to be the turn of the parliament and other noble houses. Therefore it is intended to adopt measures to prevent these things from taking place. Unfortunately those who brought the corn to market are taking it away again. The opinion is held that this poverty and distress will induce the King to conclude a speedy peace with the Huguenots.

21. The Queen of England as Censor
        Antwerp
        26 October 1573
    As I am informed, a few days ago a pamphlet is said to have appeared without the name of the author, which fell into the Queen’s hands. In this the rule of her Councillors is especially described and it is said therein that they treat Her Majesty not like a Queen, but only as a figurehead and govern entirely as suits their pleasure. She has expressed her satisfaction therewith to her secretary. However as this document was couched in rough language it has been forbidden, at the risk of corporal punishment, to buy or retain it.

21-22. The Coronation of Rudolf II in Regensburg
        Regensburg
        4 November 1575
    On All Saints’ Day there took place in the Cathedral of St. Peter of this town the coronation of the most august Sovereign, Rudolf, Roman Emperor Elect, accompanied by the customary ceremonies. There were present all the Electors and other Princes. The Archbishop of Mayence celebrated High Mass, and as the procession left the church two men on horseback scattered silver coin amongst the people. These bore on one side: “Rudolf II, elected King of Rome on the 22nd day of October 1575,” and on the other “Crowned on November 1st, 1575." It also showed a picture of an altar with six balls, over which stood: “Consentientibus Nobis." The crowds in the streets and on the square before the Town Hall were enormous. In the Town Hall seven tables were spread for the Electors. In front of the Town Hall a large ox was roasted, stuffed with all sorts of animals. There was also a fountain from the eight spouts of which there flowed red and white wine. The Emperor gave a magnificent banquet, at which each Elector had a table to himself. On the next day the King gave a second banquet for those who came from afar. The Elector of Bradenburg was the first to leave, for he had received news of the dying condition of his Consort.

22-23. The Plague in Venice
        unknown
        2 August 1576
    background: Order of the most excellent councillors chosen by the illustrious Senate for the provisioning of the City of Venice, 2nd day of August 1576.
    In order to give effect to the findings of the illustrious Senate of the 31st day of the past month, it is decreed in the interest of the general welfare and the extirpation of the contagious plague, that the streets of this city be closed for the duration of fourteen days. On no condition whatsoever are inhabitants to be allowed to move from one street to another. The Councillors charged with the provisioning of the city make known to one and all whether Venetian, or stranger, nobleman, burgher, tradesman, or of whatever rank he may be, that it is incumbent upon him, out of his own means and to the best of his ability, to provide as far as possible all needful provisions for his household, for himself, his workmen and others who are in his service; and to take good care that sufficient water be in store in his well for the afore mentioned period of fourteen days. All this must be carried out by the coming Saturday. Likewise we command all fishermen, dealers in fruit, in meat, and all others who traffic in foodstuffs, also all those who offer for sale oil, faggots and wood, to furnish their shops at once with sufficient goods and to hold them for sale in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of their street. Likewise, by the order of the illustrious Councillors it is announced that all kinds of provisions are to be purchased elsewhere and to be brought into the city. This will be facilitated and promoted by all means, and it will be permissible to trade freely therewith wherever it may happen to be.
        Venice, 1 September 1576
    Yesterday the Senate carried a resolution whereby it was decided to buy from the physician in the hospital the remedy against the present contagious plague, which he has repeatedly offered. He was there and then paid 30,000 ducats and as many gold zechines. He and his heirs are, moreover, to receive 300 ducats every month. Yesterday the secret was made public and as soon as I receive a copy of this I will send it to Your Serene Highness.

23-24. Invasion of Livonia by the Russians
        unknown
        30 August 1577
    background: Truthful, pitiable and lamentable news, written by a personality of high standing from Riga, of the horrors of the Muscovite Tyranny.
    You will doubtless have learnt to a sufficiency of the unheard-of tyranny together with pillaging, murder, burnings, rapes, incest, which the Muscovite practised from the 13th day of July to the 30th day of August in practically the whole Duchy. I believe that these lamentations and this outcry cannot have been heard among the Germans. For if our Government but knew of this and believed therein, it would feel commiseration for their poor, wretched forsaken and forgotten subjects and take pity on them, though their hearts be made of steel and stone.
    In the month of July the enemy passed through the breadth and length of the country, with eleven thousand men, ravaging, burning, and taking all prisoners. Those who were aged or offered opposition were slain and in this wise three thousand people are said to have perished. It is reported that nine thousand young men have been made prisoners. The first of their hordes we could well have vanquished by God’s grace, if we had made common cause with the Courlanders and the peasants. For the Musovite had remained behind with his chief troops and the cannon, but when he saw that we were separated, defenceless and without guns, he continued his murdering tyrannical course, taking one after the other, all the towns and localities. In one place they took forty women and virgins into a garden; they were violated there and then for hours by Muscovites without number. Then they were put on horses and taken away. The Muscovite is said to be on his way to Nonnenburg with his artillery. A few places are still holding out, but the Lord grant that our rulers may realize their obligations and not permit their poor loyal subjects to be sacrificed on the shambles. The misery and grief to be seen in this country will not allow me to write any more.

24-25. Miraculous Healings by a Hermit
unknown
25 June 1578
            background: Hans Noegl writes from Dillingen to Anton Bimmel the news of the 25th of June 1578.
    I cannot omit to report to Your Reverence thus: some days ago the reverend and highly learned Herr Venerandus Gabler, doctor of medicine at Tiedlingen, wrote a letter to the Provost of the College, wherein he tells, among other things, of a hermit at Toll in Burgundy, who performs miraculous doings and heals many sick people, of which Your Reverence may take cognizance from the attached copy. Should Your Reverence know of any unfortunate and sick persons, past all human aid, Your Reverence might well inform them to this effect: “I have received reliable news that there lives in Burgundy a hermit, who heals innumerable people—but only Catholics—from all manner of sickness, even those that are incurable. He has made the blind to see and the deaf to hear. Of late he has healed Magister Jacob, preacher at Freiburg in the Breisgau, who, afflicted with prolonged and severe pains, was therefore unable to use his limbs, so that he had to be carried and lifted. It is reported that in one single week there were four thousand sick people who visited this hermit, and that he aided the majority of them. The Commander of the District at Freiburg commends this to the consideration of our Commander. If there should be among the Jesuits or their relatives or pupils any sick person whom human knowledge is no longer able to relieve, he should go to the holy hermit, Vitus by name. Ills which arise in man from heredity or the French disease he will not accept for healing. He uses only prayer and fresh water and accepts nothing, no matter whosoever it be. He is greatly talked about by people of quality. This much have I wished not to withhold from Your Reverence’s friendly and well-meaning consideration in case you should not already be informed of it. Herewith I commend you and all your brotherhood to Divine Mercy.”

25-27. Death of King Sebastian of Portugal
        Lisbon 
        25 August 1578 
    I cannot hide from you the regrettable and unheard-of disaster which befell our King and his whole army in Africa. On the 3rd day of this month, our King marched forward to encounter the enemy, meaning to arrive at Alcazar on the same day. Now it happened that Mome Malucho was lying in wait for the King’s forces outside Alcazar with fourteen thousand men on horseback and on foot, and he sent an advance guard of about four thousand mounted troops in order to skirmish with them. This filled our King with gladness, so that he ordered his whole army to advance. The Captains of the Germans and the Italians did not deem this wise and they came of their own accord to the King to inform him that the soldiery were in no fit condition, and, moreover, tired, because they had had naught to eat for a long while. They craved therefore that they might be allowed to entrench themselves and to wait until provisions and more fighters were brought up from the fleet. The King had in all not more than twenty-three thousand men on foot and sixteen hundred on horseback. The remainder of his forces he had left behind with his fleet or had bidden them to accompany the Sherif, Mulei Mehemed, who had marched on Masegna, and whose father fell in the ensuing battle. But when the King had listened to the counsel of both Commanders, he shook his head and said: “Let us march, let us march!”  He ordered such great haste to be made that the cannon, which had formerly headed the army, was finally left behind and in the end unable to come to their assistance. Thereupon the King in person, with his horsemen began the skirmish with four thousand men. In the meanwhile more and more Turks joined in, until at last their whole army hastened on the scene in half-moon formation, surrounding our forces and taking the cannon, which fired from behind, but could hit no one but our own men.
    The Portuguese nobility withstood the onslaught for an hour, but they almost all fell on the battlefield. Likewise the Germans, Italians and Spaniards sold their lives dearly. But no more than ten or twelve of them came away alive. The rest were slain with their captains. But the Portuguese infantry surrendered at an early hour. Some of them shot first and then ran away, and some let their blunderbusses drop and surrendered.
    Our King bore himself right bravely, and, so it is said, killed many Turks with his own hands, but at last, after he had mounted the third horse, he disappeared so that no one has found him either alive or dead until this hour.
    Among the noblemen, of whom not more than sixteen are left, there is also the son of the Duke of Braganza, a young Lord, who drove in a gilt coach to meet the enemy. He had a thousand riflemen with him which his father had given him for his protection. But these were all mown down, and the young Lord was taken from the carriage, for he was believed to be the King. The Turks threw him twice into the air for joy, but he cried out that he was not the King, but the son of the Duke of Braganza, and besought them that his life might be spared as his father would ransom him with much money. With this the Turks were well satisfied.
    When this sorry news came unto us, you can well imagine how great were the lamentations, the despair and the grief, not only in this city, but in all the land. The men went about as if dazed. The wailing of the women was so loud that it can be compared with that which arose at the taking of Antwerp. It is a woeful matter to lose in one day the King, their husbands, their sons, and all the goods and chattels they had with them. But what is even more terrible is that this kingdom now must fall under Spanish rule, which they can brook the least of all. May God Almighty therefore perform a miracle by our pious old Cardinal, who is a man of sixty-four, and grant him a male heir. It is also said that His Highness is willing to marry for the sake of this kingdom. Although there were others of the royal blood, such as the Infant Antonio, they have all fallen in this battle. Not one is left but our Cardinal, who made his way here at once on receiving the pitiful tidings. As is reported, the pledge of loyalty will be sworn unto him next week.
    Otherwise business here continues as though nothing untoward had taken place. The ships that arrived from India are being unloaded, the merchants ply their trade and go to sea; it is the nobility and soldiers alone who have perished. No merchant has suffered thereby since they all stayed behind. The four regents whom the King appointed to rule the kingdom in his absence were ratified in their office by the Cardinal. The Government and officials deal with the people in so friendly a manner that every one is astounded thereat. In spite of these terrible tidings no riots have occurred and if a stranger, who had never been here before came to this city, he would swear by all that is holy that no ill-fortune has befallen this kingdom for one hundred years.
    This letter has lain here for lack of news until the 25th. To-day definite information arrived that our King fell in battle and was taken by the Moors to one of their cities, Alcazar by name. His adversary, the Moorish King Malucho, and the other Sheriff have also perished, therefore in one and the same battle three Kings and many noblemen on both sides were slain.
    The Cardinal was appointed yesterday Governor of the Kingdom by the Council, and, as decisive news of the King’s death has been received, he is to be elected King to-morrow.

28-29. Coronation of King Henry of Portugal
unknown
unknown
            background: Short report on the ceremonies attendant on the bewailing of the late King Don Sebastian and the election of the Cardinal of Portugal, Don Enrique, as King.
    On the 27th day of August of the year 1578 a nobleman stepped forth from the Town Hall in Lisbon, clad in black brocade, wearing a long robe closed in front, and trailing behind. Outside the Town Hall he bestrode a horse decked in black. He was given to hold in his hand a large black flag which he let trail on the ground. Three men went before him who were robed in long black cloaks which they also let drag far behind them. Each of them carried a wooden shield. First they went as far as the big church and one of them mounted the highest step and cried out aloud: “Citizens, I give you tidings that your King Don Sebastian is dead!”  Thereupon he splintered his buckler against the stone steps. Then they went to the Rua Nova, cried the same news there and broke the second buckler. From there they went to the Hospital where they destroyed the third one. These four men were followed by all the officials of the city, clad in black silken cloaks, also by innumerable crowds who wept pitifully and cried aloud: “Oh! what shall we do?”  They kicked one another with their feet and tore their hair. They also ran against the walls with their heads and did other things that were passing strange. The next day, on the morning of the 28th, between eight and nine o’clock, the Cardinal rode from the Palace of the Duke of Braganza, where he had lived, and went on his way to the Hospital. He sat on his mule, which was harnessed in beautiful red cloth, and he was clad in a long red robe. On his head he wore a Cardinal’s hat. Three counts led the mule by the halter. All the noblemen present in Lisbon—there were but few of them on account of the African battle—preceded him bareheaded and behind him went all the officials, Alcaldes and such like. Then followed six trumpeters on horseback clad in red and white damask and then three mounted drummers in black. Then came six men on horseback each of whom held a large, heavy silver mace in his hand and thereafter nine heralds in handsome doublets. They had the King’s coat of arms on back and front. Behind them rode the Duke of Braganza on a beautiful steed. He carried in his hand an unsheathed gilt sword. On his right walked Don Juan Delo. Near the Hospital there had been erected a high tribune. The Cardinal stepped on to this and took his place on a delicately wrought royal chair. In front of him there stood a table on which lay a book. When the Cardinal was seated a nobleman prostrated himself at his feet and tendered the royal sceptre unto him. Thereupon the Secretary Miguel de Moto took his oath that he would respect the privileges and liberties granted to the country by its former Kings. He then returned again amidst the sound of the trumpets and the kettledrums with unfurled standards to the house of the Duke of Braganza, who with the heralds rode ahead of him with unsheathed sword. The heralds called out in loud tones throughout the city: “Real! Real! Real!”  These cries were heard almost all day. May Almighty God give unto this King a long life and make his rule felicitous.

29-30. Murders in Paris
        Paris
        5 December 1578
    Of news we have none, save that on the last day of November the Secretary of the Duke of Florence, who together with the Ambassador has been here a year or two, was taken into custody by the Court Provost by order of the King. It is supposed that this was done because of several murders which were committed here some time ago, and which the Duke of Florence is said to have instigated. Not long since he caused Don Troilus d’Orsini to be shot at night by his servants between the hours of eight and nine. Suspicion falls upon him because the said Troilus stood in too close a friendship with the Duke’s sister. Some fourteen days ago, a Florentine, of the name of Capitano Bernardo, was shot in the suburb of St. Germain. The culprit was caught and put to the rack. After all his members had been broken, he was given water to drink twice as he lay on the wheel. It was only then that much information was gained from him, and it is said he confessed that he had taken money from the said Secretary to commit this and the other crime. The culprit was an Italian who has already done six people to death.

34-35. A Christ taken Prisoner
        Seville, 8 June 1579
    Of news we have none of import to give you these days. But a curious occurrence recently took place five miles from here, in a village, St. Ginar by name. An inhabitant thereof took refuge in the church to escape his creditors. But whereas, according to custom, on the day of the Blessed Sacrament, all kinds of entertainment were to take place before the Procession of the Blessed Host, some inhabitants had erected a cart, on which they wished to hold a mystery play showing how our Lord Jesus Christ was captured by the Jews as he was kneeling on the Mount of Olives. But they stood in need of a stately and beauteous man and knowing of none more worthy or better looking, they craved of the man, who had taken refuge in the church because of his debts, that he would play the part of the Lord God in their play. He resisted for a long time as he dared not leave the church on account of those to whom he owed money, but the others gave him the assurance that they would bring the cart, on which the play was to be held, in front of the church; where he could mount and descend and need not harbour fear. Thereupon the latter consented. But when one of his creditors learnt this, he bethought himself of many ways in which he could have his debtor seized and thrust into prison. To that end he held counsel with an Alguazil, who informed him that he had a good friend who would play the part of Judas in the said performance. This man he would present with half a dozen ducats and instruct him that, when they arrived on the Market Place, and Judas gave our dear Lord the kiss, he should likewise give him a strong push, so that he might fall from the cart. Once he touched the ground he would immediately be made prisoner. This proposal pleased the creditor greatly. He thereupon gave the Alguazil some money and promised him more as soon as he had got his debtor into prison. thus when the procession reached the market, where the Alguazil and his minions were lying in wait, Judas at once strove to carry out his purpose, and with the Jews proceeded to approach the Lord, whom he took to the tail of the cart, where he gave him so forcible a kiss and a push, that he fell to the ground. The Alguazil captured him then and there; but as the good Lord was looking most woefully at his disciples, St. Peter, who stood next to him with his sword, took pity upon him and almost cleft the Alguazil’s head in twain. Thereupon a great turmoil ensued in the whole village, so that the Justice intervened and arrested St. Peter, the Lord, and Judas with all his Jews. Thereupon the Judge proclaimed: S E N T E N T I A, Firstly, Judas to be given the birch for a scoffer of God. Secondly, the Alguazil to have himself physicked at his own cost. Thirdly, St. Peter to be set free, as a pious and faithful apostle, and the Lord likewise. The merchant to forfeit that which the Lord owes unto him and to make no further demands upon him for all eternity.
    Of this, for lack of better news, have I wished to give tidings unto you.

35-38. Tournaments in Prague
        Prague
        15 June 1579
    On the 5th day of this coming month of July, Christopher Popel, the Chamberlain of His Royal and Imperial Majesty, is to hold his nuptials with the daughter of the late Molard, here in Prague, where, at the same time as other frolic, there will be held such like jousts, at which Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria will be Mantenator, as are set forth in the challenge attached hereby. Above all be it known that: whereas the lofty and supreme Pallas, the Goddess of Wisdom and Arms has heard the news that the Knights of the far-famed and illustrious roman Court exercise themselves in an elegant, yet manly fashion, in all manner of knightly prowess, with assiduity, diligence, zeal and fervour, she has derived therefrom no little joy, being a lover and patron of such arts. To encourage Knights to even greater perseverance and ardour in the exercise of armed skill, and to restrain them from idleness from which spring vice and mischief of all kinds, also to fire them with greater zest in the practice of jousts, she has recalled from the Campis Eysiis, the mighty Knight Philotetus of Greece, who performed such doughty deeds at the siege of Troy and showed himself specially versed in the arts of joust, above all others. Him she sent to the Royal Capital of Prague, in order that he might there promote a new joust with the honourable knighthood. All this she does the more willingly, since she learnt that in the coming month of July there is to take place a notable and stately wedding in the aforementioned city of Prague, at which, doubtless many a good Knight will be present. Therefore, the great Goddess aforenamed wishes one and all of the knighthood to know that they have been asked to attend upon the 6th day of the coming month of July at 12 o’clock at noon, in the square Philocteti, in Prague, in order to essay a new and famous joust under the aforementioned Knight Philotetus as Mantenator. To prove more clearly the pleasure and delight which the mighty Goddess takes in the knighthood and their love of jousts, she has decreed that her own picture or statue be erected on the said square, so that it may serve for this new joust and also act as a fresh incentive, and instil into the whole knighthood even greater joy and enthusiasm. She will also be present at the time stated and at the appointed place. In what guise prizes are to be won or lost at this joust, and how people are to deport themselves follows hereunder: The figure erected will hold in its hand an iron ring or an iron target, at which competitors are to tilt or whereon they are to break their spears. The aforementioned Mantenator will run three carreras with each of the competing Venturiers for a Pretium (prize) of ten to one hundred thalers. Likewise such races are to be run in masques without weapons or armour of any sort, iron gloves or such like privilege. To this end each Venturier is to present himself to the Judge in order that it may be seen and proved that he does not have such advantage or make use of it over the Mantenator.
    No one is to run with spears other than those which are handed out by the Judges. Whoever, in the three races breaks several spears on the target, will be deemed to have won the Pretium. Two hits are to count for one broken spear. Whoever tilts the spear lower than the target, either in jumping or in running, ere he arrives thereat, and missing it, again raises the spear and then makes a hit or breaks the spear, is to be held as having won the race. Whoever takes his aim before, or in the act of jumping, is to be disqualified. Whoever breaks the spear after the race or in parrying across the shoulder so that it touches the shoulder, is not to be permitted to win. Whoever grasps (or handles) the spear improperly or is lacking in the elegance required from him, is likewise held to have lost the prize. No one is to be allowed to change his steed during the three carreras. If anyone through soreness of foot or other such legitimate cause be prevented from completing the race, he may be permitted to run in another, but should his horse not run properly and so make it impossible for him to finish the race, he will then be held to have lost it.
    Should the Mantenator and a Venturier obtain the same points in the breaking of the spear or hitting the target, they are not to run again; but he has won, who, according to the verdict of the Judge has carried himself through the race in the most elegant and seemly fashion. Since it has occurred at various times that the Pretium was accorded even to those who ran with but little grace, the Mantenator craves of the Judges that they keep a keen eye upon the manner in which the race is run because the Mantenator has much to do with the race, and the Venturier but little. This is case he and the Venturier have scored alike in breaking and hitting. The Judges, in order to award the prize, are not to take into account the number of the runs, but the graceful bearing of the competitors during the race. Should doubts arise, they are to be left to the competence of the Judges.
    Herewith and finally the Mantenator craves of the Judges that they adjudicate strictly and solely according to this capitulation. This much will the worthy Knight Philotetus always deserve from the Judges.
    Thereupon follow the prizes:
    Whosoever breaks the first spear most gracefully and felicitously on the target or the ring, is to win the first prize.
    Whosoever in three races, breaks the most spears, or makes the most hits also wins a prize.
    Whosoever breaks the most spears in a Folia, is to receive accordingly the Folia prize.
    Whosoever is hailed by the eminent Goddess as Mascolo, is to win the Mascolo prize.
    From these four prizes, the Mantenator, as is customary, will not consider himself to be excluded.

38-46. Letter from Cochin-China
        Cochin in India, 10 January 1580
    Honourable, most kindly and dear Signor Adelgais!
    Before my departure from Lisbon I informed you how I with my companions boarded our ships. Upon the 4th day of April 1579 all five vessels sailed from Lisbon at the same time; but we did not however, keep together for more than six days, but each soon struck out on its own course, since each captain or pilot believes he knows best how to arrive first at the goal. Although these ships are big and powerful, they strive not to stay together. When we had been on our way for a month and had chanced first on the coast of Guinea and later upon the Linea Aequinoxialis, we realized that we had left Lisbon far too late. We had to sail back and forth along this Linea until we could pass it, and in this wise lost forty-seven days. Since at this time the sun shines at its strongest and hottest, we had to suffer great heat and torment on this voyage. From thence as far as the thirty-fourth degree in the other half of the globe, towards the South pole or the Pole Antarctico, as far as the Cape of Good Hope, we had a favourable wind and fair weather, but severe cold. From thence onward we experienced several great storms. To tell the truth, I would have preferred then to be elsewhere than on this voyage. God be praised, we came through. But it is an old experience in seafaring that come or go, one has to meet such storms. This danger lasts for one hundred and fifty miles, which one covers in thirty-four days. We then arrived at the twenty-sixth degree off the height of Mozambique. There the King of Portugal keeps a fort and a garrison. But whereas it was late in the year, we were not permitted to land, but stayed out at sea fifty miles therefrom. If we had gone ashore, we should not have been able to leave again. We then came upon the Linea Aequinoxialis which we passed in three days. Thereupon we passed on again to the other side towards the North Pole.
    Here in Cochin we are situate on the ninth degree from this line and on the side of Europe. Lisbon lies thirty-nine degrees off this line. In this place it is rather warm since we are just under the ninth degree. We arrived, thanks and praise be to the Lord Almighty, upon the 10th day of October at the town of Goa, which belongs to the King of Portugal and is the finest capital in this country. Thus we have been on our way here from Lisbon six months and six days, and during that time have seen no land, only the sky and the sea. The Lord God bestows on such journeys His special blessing and mercy, for otherwise it would not be possible to spend half a year between the planks. To sum up, whosoever is well equipped with provisions and a cook, both of which were mine, thanks to the Lord, feels the hardships of such a voyage less than the common people, who suffer great distress from lack of food and drink, especially water, which no money can buy. In such heat one cannot partake of much wine, only water, of which, thanks be to God, I had in sufficient quantity with our food. There were about five hundred persons in our ship of whom not more than twenty-five altogether died on the way from Portugal to India. Some of us, who were well provided with food and drink, extended much help to the poor soldiery. In this half year we have traversed five thousand miles. Although for the direct route from Lisbon to India one counts not more than three thousand miles, one covers at all times for each voyage five thousand miles on account of the head winds.
    I have seen many kinds of fish, whereof there would be much to write, especially of those that fly above the sea and have wings. This many will not wish to believe, but I have seen them a thousand times fly as near as the musket will carry. What called forth still greater surprise on my part were other big fishes that are in the ocean and that eat man alive, whereof I have been myself a witness. For when a man fell from our ship into the sea during a strong wind, so that we could not wait for him or come to his rescue in any other fashion, we threw out to him on a rope a wooden block, especially prepared for that purpose, and this he finally managed to grasp and thought he could save himself thereby. But when our crew drew this block with the man toward the ship and had him within half the carrying distance of a musket shot, there appeared from below the surface of the sea a large monster, called Tiburon; it rushed on the man and tore him to pieces before our very eyes. That surely was a grievous death.
    There were also many kinds of birds upon the sea, among them many which never see land, but always dwell upon the waters. They eat fish and do not fear the people on the ship. We have with our hands caught several of these birds. They are the size of ducks, but are reputed not to be fit to eat, because they smack so strongly of fish.
    I have related our journey day by day, and have made therewith a book, which in good time, if God helps me out of this again, I shall bring with me together with many beauteous things. This voyage is of such nature that he who does not experience it himself, could not believe how arduous it is. Thanks be to God, that myself and my men, four young Germans, have arrived here in India fresh and well; but no sooner did we set foot on land, than four young Portuguese servants of mine expired. On the ship eating and much drinking of water causes havoc, and ashore it is dangerous for some time, because of the many fruits, such as figs and other foods. But also there is a danger on account of the women, of whom there is an abundance. From all the ships a good many men died ashore. Until a man gets acclimatized he has to guard himself wisely. Thanks be to God, I am very well.
    Our ships have all five arrived from Lisbon, namely, three in Goa and two here. Now all five ships are here in Cochin. I made a sojourn of four weeks in the town of Goa and built me there a house. From thence I travelled one hundred miles onwards by sea. The voyage can be made in ten to twelve days. The ships are loaded with pepper here in Cochin, twenty miles from Calicut, wherefore they all have to come to this place. I shall maintain two establishments, one in Goa and the other here. I have not yet, however, resolved upon which shall fall my choice for remaining definitely. Although Goa is the capital in which the Viceroy of Portugal holds his Court, it is wearisome to journey back and forth every year, as I needs must be present in this our pepper store.
    Such a pepper store is a fine business, but it requires great zeal and perseverance. It takes six weeks to receive the pepper from the heathen King of Cochin, who is our friend, and to load it into our ships. After the departure of these ships for Portugal I and my servants have but little to do. The pepper business is profitable indeed; when the Lord God grants by His mercy that none of the ships take damage either in coming or going, then the merchants wax rich. With these sailings, all depends upon the right time to take the journey, to wit, during the month of March from Lisbon to this place, and from here to Portugal during the month of January. Also, when this can be arranged, to leave neither place later than upon the 15th day of these months. Then the risk is slight. But it is dangerous to take one’s departure later, for then one comes across heavy storms, and has to go by a circuitous route, and often the ships are destroyed. This happens but rarely, provided the ships do not run aground, founder or otherwise come to grief. Great caution has to be practised in these respects.
    This year, in my judgment, we shall not dispatch more than four ships with about twenty loads, although we ought to send thirty. We already possess the money, for so large a sum would not be obtainable by loan. What we are lacking this day can be bought, given a good opportunity, after the sailing of these ships for next year. Of all other spices such as cloves, nutmeg, flour and nuts, cinnamon, maces, and various drugs, this year’s supplies are going to Portugal. In precious stones little was dispatched this year on account of the war, which the heathen Kings (of which there are many in this country) waged one upon another. Because of this, precious stones cannot come through from inland into our towns since all of them lie upon the shores of the sea.
    All that lieth inland belongs to the Indians, heathens and Moors. We boast of the friendship of two or three of these Kings, but the majority are our enemies. Our fleet is continually fighting them at sea. The King of Portugal despite all his power is too weak for this vast country. The King of Spain, if he but took possession of Portugal, would be the right King for these lands. He should take over the whole of India all the kingdoms and provinces right into China, where it adjoins Tartary, and unite under his rule his Spanish India with the Portuguese municipalities: this he could accomplish with fifty thousand men. Even though the Kindian Kings have a goodly number of warriors, and there are many such Kings, they are not good fighters. One Christian can achieve more than six Indians. Besides, these Kings are continually involved in strife and quarrels amongst themselves.
    The land in itself is bad, it produces all the corn, rice and meat that is needed, but no wine and no olive oil: it also lacks five or six kinds of fruit. Wine, oil and Dutch cheese are brought from Portugal. The country is equally warm throughout the year, in winter as in summer. There exists no difference in the seasons. In winter it is as hot as in summer, only that it rains throughout the whole winter, which in summer it does not do. The days are of twelve hours’ duration all the year round, they grow neither longer nor shorter. The trees and grass remain verdant throughout the year. We have figs here that are as large as the span of the hand, which figs are picked from the trees the whole year round. One may pick them every day, they are the most important and the staple food for rich and poor alike. It grows on beautiful tall trees, which are called palms. These bear a fruit of the size and shape of a melon which contains much water. Whosoever does not know or see it, cannot imagine what manner of things can be made from this fruit. Thou canst however completely trust in me, for my information is good.
    From this fruit one maketh wine, which is good to drink, also oil which is good for eating and burning, also milk and fat and a special paper on which one can write. This fruit is kept in store rooms. Its husk is used for making wooden crockery, dishes and other things. Moreover, one makes out of these trees all that is needed for navigation, to wit, the ship, mast, sails, nails, ropes, cables, tow, and likewise wooden bricks for roofing houses. These ships carry provisions in food and drink which are also derived from this tree. I have already seen myself ships thus fashioned. It is a strange thing, and I have desired not to omit to advise thee of this with all the other curiosities here. With God’s help, I will write to thee in this coming year more particulars about curious customs and strange happenings; but they are as yet new to me, though I have already been in this country for three months. Every day I see new usages about which one might write a large book. I will endeavour, as time goes on to collect many strange things and after five years, if I continue in my present purpose, to take them home with me. God willing, I shall employ for my home-coming another route, namely, one by land. From here one goes by sea towards Ormus in Arabia, thence to Persia and there one has good opportunity to travel through the Sophi’s land and Turkey. As I learn from those that come and go from Italy, this is a very good road, for it is much used. One finds people in Ormus who assure one that they will bring you safely from Ormus to Italy. It appears quite a common thing. I shall, however, inform myself well beforehand since I have the time to do so. By this route it is not quite two thousand miles from here to Italy or Germany and these one can cover within six months: moreover the Holy Land and Jerusalem and other such like places can be visited on the way, and so I feel much more inclined to see something more of these lands, than to go by sea, where one is in hourly peril of the ship suffering damage or being wrecked.
    I ought to recount to thee many other such strange things, which however cannot be done at this moment. In the coming year I will send thee a picture to show how every one is dressed here, to wit, bare or naked, man and women. The King and noblemen as well as the common man, only cover their shame. The Portuguese are clad only in very light garments, linen or silk. On account of the heat, woollens cannot be worn. People here have many beliefs and ceremonies. But as time goes, more and more Indians are converted to Christendom though others remain heathens. The Moors and the Jews retain their Faith. In these lands many creeds exist, but in the towns belonging to the Portuguese, the heathens or Indians are mostly converted to the Christian Faith. I also cannot omit to tell you of another custom of this country. All the Kings have always thirty, forty, yes, even one hundred wives, as many as it pleases them to keep. When such a King dies or perishes in battle, these his wives must throw themselves into the fire and burn to death. In many places outside this town it is the custom also among the common heathen people that the widow of a dead heathen must likewise allow herself to be burnt alive. If she does not, she is mocked and derided. There exists still another custom. When a maiden of a noble house or of reputed ancestry marries, her kinsmen strive to persuade the King to sleep with her the first night. Much money is given to him to that end, otherwise she cannot marry. Of such customs there are many more besides this.
    Also, I would tell thee that the five ships from Portugal were sent to our master. Thou shouldst know that from the sale of wine, oil, Dutch Cheese, fish, paper and other things, usually the greatest profit is derived; this time no gain at all remains. All this has brought in no more than twelve to fifteen per cent., and on the ready cash brought from Lisbon one makes but a profit of twenty-five per cent. The country is no longer as it was formerly, and apart from this, our Viceroy imposes so many new taxes that all commerce diminishes. If he remains here, no good will come of it. I am of the belief however, that the King of Portugal will send hither another Viceroy when he hears of the doings of this present one. There is no merchandise now that can be sent with profit from here to Portugal.
    In precious stones there is nothing this year; in fact this country is not such as is generally imagined. It takes as much trouble to earn money here as in other places. Things are no longer what they were twenty years ago. Buying and selling here is more profitable than sending many wares to Portugal. German merchandise has no market here and is useless for this country. Writing tables split in the great heat, clockwork, or anything else made of iron, deteriorates at sea. This year there is nothing to send to Portugal, for pepper, ginger, maces, cocoa-nut fat have all been brought for the contractors, also cinnamon for the King. One really does not know this time in what to invest one’s money.
    The fisher has imported Dutch cheese, but is not going to derive great profit from it, since much of it was stolen aboard ship. This likewise happened to our stores. In addition, our sales have been bad. Five ships can bring much into port, and thus everything becomes cheap. The Portuguese here are even more diligent than the people in Lisbon. The Pietras de Bezoar are always very dear and not good. After the ships have departed I will try to obtain privately some of these stones that are good, and to send them to thee next year.

46-48. The Death of Philippine Welser
        Innsbruck, 1580
    The Most Serene Princess and Lady, Philippine, Consort of the Serene and Highborn Prince and Lord, Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, was taken ill by Divine Ordinance of God Almighty, on the 14th day of April of the year 1580, and has on the 24th day of the said month, taken leave from this vale of tears in a Christian, peaceful and exemplary manner.
    After the most worthy Princess had felt very weak on the 23rd day of the above-named month, she made her confession, according to Catholic custom and at the advice and instigation of her Father Confessor, in deep repentance and sorrow. The ensuing day, between 5 and 6 o’clock in the morning she received the Blessed Sacrament with special devoutness, and several hours thereafter, Extreme Unction with great reverence. But her strength ebbing little by little, she implored her Lord and Spouse, in submission and humility, graciously to extend his pardon to her, in case she had not always lived obediently as was the gracious will and pleasure of His Princely Highness, or contravened his wishes by word or deed. The pious Princess gave proof of so great and constant a forbearance that not one single sign of impatience was she seen to make.
    She was heard to say several times that she was willing and ready to suffer patiently these and other pains, as long as the dear Lord willed it thus. Whereas even in her death struggle she preserved her consciousness and clear speech, she listened with joy when spoken to about heavenly matters and herself continuously begged God for forgiveness of her sins, for patience, perseverance in the Christian Faith and for help against all wicked temptations. She often and firmly prayed:
    “Oh, Thou merciful God, forgive me my sins and trespasses. Father, I have sinned before Heaven and before Thee and am not worthy to be called Thy Child. Lord, let my soul be cleansed in Thy rose-red blood, let Thy bitter Death and Thy joyful Resurrection be my victory and triumph.”
    Although she had been warned on account of her bodily weakness not to say the prayers aloud, she was yet able to manifest that in her heart she repeated all those that were said in her presence, especially the Paternoster, the Angelus, and the Credo. Likewise, many beautiful things did she say during the last moments of her life. The cross of Indulgence with which she had been honoured by His Holiness the Pope she was seen to kiss reverently and unceasingly and on three occasions she was heard to laugh unexpectedly. And as His Serene Highness questioned her why she was laughing, she made answer: “I see that which gladdens me.”
    She was by nature of so virtuous and modest a dispostion that even in her death agony she would not permit the least uncovering of her body, and drew her sleeves over her arms down to her wrists. She humbly commended her brother, Herr Carl Welser, Chief Chamberlain to His Highness, to the favour of Her Serene Spouse. When she at last became aware that God was about to make an end of her, she gazed lovingly at His Serene Highness and gave him her right hand with the words: “May God take care of you!”  Thereupon she imparted to her most beloved sons the motherly warning not to displease their father, but to render unto him most perfect obedience. Likewise, she gave her blessing to Herr Ferdinand, Duke of Upper and Lower Bavaria, and Herr Otto Heinrich, Duke of Brunswick. She bade the Duke of Bavaria to take leave in her name of all the princely house of Bavaria. She counselled Herr Jaroslav of Kolowrat, a young nobleman and blood relation, to avoid giving His Serene Highness any cause for displeasure. Shortly afterwards, she stretched forth her right hand to all present and commended them to God. When the Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria had held the burning candle for her for a long time, she said to His Serene Highness: “Your Dilection is getting tired!”  In short, Her Serene Highness conducted herself until the very last with complete and unimpaired intelligence, in a most Christian and God-fearing manner, in word and deed towards God and her relatives. To the Eternal and bounteous Deity, from Whom sprang the blessed dead, be all Praise, Honour and Glory for all times! May He grant this Christian Princess a glorious resurrection. Amen, dear Lord Jesus Christ! Amen!

48. Disputes at the Court of Prague
        Prague
        15 May 1580
    Last week, Monsieur de Roche, Imperial Carver, and Allegret d’Allegretti, Imperial Lord High Steward, fell into dispute while gambling in the refectory. They unsheathed their rapiers, against one another. Whereupon the following sentence was passed in the presence of all Court officials: Monsieur de Roche as originator of this and other quarrels after serving his sentence of imprisonment, is to be confined for a further month in the White Tower here. Thereafter he is to quit the Imperial Court, and to shun this, as well as all the Hereditary Lands of the Crown at the risk of body and soul. Allegret d’Allegretti, after having served his term of imprisonment, is to leave the Emperor’s Court within fifteen days and to be banished from it for ever. This punishment has been ordained at the personal behest and order of His Imperial Majesty.

49. The Spaniards Conquer Lisbon
        Lisbon
        1 September 1580
    My neglect in writing to you for so long a time is due to the war and strife we have had here. For on the 25th day of August the Duke of Alba conquered Lisbon at the point of the sword. The saying goes that nigh upon three thousand persons perished on the side of the Portuguese, part of whom I myself have seen in the outer town. The dead lay heap on heap like swine. I went in the company of the Count of Lodron, who is quartered in our house, to the field of battle. All the streets are filled with dead men and horses, so that we had to walk across them as on a bridge. Some are still alive, one man lifted a foot, another a hand, yet another his head. Altogether it was a pitiable sight. The outer town also which is much larger than the town proper, was plundered for the duration of three whole days. Everything was taken away. Not a nail in the wall was left. But no soldiers came into the town, because the Duke of Alba sternly forbade it. The army is still encamped without the town. Thanks be to God, no harm has come to us.
    Four days ago five ships arrived here from India. One more was to have come which had sailed this year for Portuguese India, but it turned back on its way. No one can say what became of the ships that were sent out to meet the fleet.

49-50. Execution of a Bohemian Nobleman for Street Robbery
        Prague
        30 October 1580
    I know nothing of note whereof to write to you, save that at the last session of the Provincial Law Court the beheading of a stately nobleman, of the name of Vodratsky, who had committed robbery, was ordered to take place, on the 20th day of the month. He was a man of about sixty years of age. His estates were worth over one hundred and fifty thousand thalers, and now they have all fallen to his Imperial Majesty. There was much sorrowing on his account, for after he was sentenced, his wife, with four daughters and two sons all prostrated themselves at the feet of the Emperor, the Empress, and the nobles of the land. This scene took place in public in the Diet Chamber and was most pitiable. His Imperial Majesty granted a reprieve, and Vodratsky might be alive and well now, yet he did not wish this, but said that whatsoever punishment was due to him, he was ready to take. fourteen days earlier he dined with Herr von Brunnenstein, who in vain attempted to dissuade him from his purpose. As he came out, free and unfettered from the palace he halted outside the Diet Chamber from whence the officers looked down upon him. With these he held converse for nigh on half an hour until the noble lords were moved to tears, for he entreated them on behalf of his children and commended them to their care, so that they might not be driven from his estates. Thereupon he wrote a letter in the Tower wherein he besought the people to forget him. This the aged Herr von Wartenberg, who has Vodratsky’s sister for spouse, communicated to His Majesty. Thereupon Herr von Wartenberg weeping, brought the following message: “The Clerk is to accept this letter and after the sentence has been carried out and Justice has received its due, it is to be read out in public." Whereupon he, Vodratsky, proceeded to his execution halting a long time before Herr von Dietrichstein and praying for his children. He then went valiantly to his death and was beheaded on a black cloth spread upon the ground. Not far from this spot a carriage waited with a bier thereon. The carriage was drawn by four horses draped in black, and behind it was led his favourite steed. When he had been executed, his servants wrapped him in the black shroud, laid him upon the bier and conveyed him to his domain, where he was buried.
    There are still many such fellows in this land, and as rumour has it, the names of one hundred and thirty are registered on a list.

51. War between the English and the Irish
        London
        19 November 1580
    From Ireland we receive the news that the Spaniards and rebels have taken up fortified positions upon the seashore at Smerwick where they are besieged by the English by land and water. A large ship from Spain laden with grain was forced by a ship of the Royal Fleet to run on to the rocks. The crew took refuge in the fortress, but the corn remained in the ship.
    Forty-six horses laden with gold and silver for the Treasury of the Queen, have arrived here this week, each horse carrying two hundred and twenty pounds in weight. It is believed that this represents her share for promising to defend Captain Drake. It seems as though he will again make an expedition to the Moluccas, which voyage he can accomplish there and back again within twelve months.

51. Wailings in Prague
        Prague
        14 February 1581
    A few days ago towards noon, just as we were about to partake of our meal, a noise resembling thunder or the fire of muskets, passed, travelling swiftly over the town. And during the ensuing night the sound of lamentation was heard behind the palace, and likewise by the look-out in the White Tower. The same cries also arose in the Old Town. The bohemians call this the “Mother in Travail,” who in time past has appeared, emitting similar wailings. Thereafter a terrible plague broke out so that people fell ill in the street, leaned against a wall, dropped to the ground and died. But none here pay heed to it, and the Bohemian people surrender themselves to godlessness and fornication. May God preserve us from sudden death and may He manifest His mercy unto us!

52. Religious Feuds in Antwerp
        Cologne
        20 April 1581
    Those of the Reformed Faith in Antwerp now covet the Church of St. Michael, which has been previously refused to the adherents of the Augsburg tenets. It is supposed however, that those aforementioned will obtain not only this church, but finally all the churches. On the 13th day of this month Burgomaster Junius arrived in Antwerp at the Convent of St. Clair with the renegade Abbot of St. Bernard. They urged upon the nuns that it was not good to live so secluded a life, and exhorted them to leave the cloister and to be married. The spouse of the said Abbot is especially reported to have spoken many lewd words. This is the beginning of an attempt to entice all the clerics from the monasteries and the town of Antwerp.

52-53. Iconoclasm in Belgium
        Antwerp
        2 May 1581
    Eight days ago the soldiery and the Calvinists mutilated all the pictures and altars in the churches and cloisters of Belgium. The clergy and near on five hundred Catholic citizens were driven out and several among them cast into prison. Thus an end has been made of the Catholic Faith in Brussels, and Calvinism has been installed in its stead. Since then, the masters of the guilds or brotherhoods, and the artisans, whose ancestors had founded several beautiful chapels and altars in the Church of our Dear Lady, have demanded that they themselves should be allowed to remove from the church the painted pictures and other ornaments. Upon the evening of the Feast of the Ascension they began to pull down the altars, occupied the churches and kept them locked until this day. . . . It is not known whether they will destroy everything within the church, but it is believed that it will come to pass here as it did in Brussels. . . . But as Catholics and Calvinists cannot keep peace with the Lutherans and Anapapists it will ill serve the promotion of commerce and many persons will leave this town.
        Antwerp, 6 May 1581
    Four ships lie here laden with sculptured and carved statues, bells, brass and stone effigies of saints, brass candlesticks and other such like ornaments from the churches. All these are to be dispatched to Narva and Moscow. The consigners hope to do good business with them.
        Antwerp, 5 July 1581
    In the past days the Calvinists here have wrought much havoc. On the day of St. Jacques they ravaged the Church of Our Lady, the Church of St. Jacques, and the Palace Chapel, as well as the Convent of St. Michel, where up to now the Catholics held their religious exercises and ceremonies, in such fashion that they have wrecked everything therein, with the exception of the organ and a few pictures. They spared nothing and destroyed everything completely. On the 27th day in broad daylight, a Captain of the burghers, a painter with sundry artisans went with large hammers and other iron instruments into all the monasteries, chapels, hospitals and other houses of God, in short to every place where there still existed pictures and altars and destroyed them. Many of the wooden effigies were burned in the streets, where the burghers kept guard. Not one person did protest against this, since the rule of the clergy is completely destroyed and at an end here.

        Antwerp
        15 July 1581
    This afternoon at 1 o’clock, the Town Council issued an announcement whereby it is no longer permitted to practise the Catholic Religion. It is still, however, permissible for Catholics to baptize their children in their own fashion and have their marriages blessed by their priests. The adherents of the Reformed Faith wish to have it all their own way, but this kind of rule will not endure as time goes on, and evil will arise from it, for too much rope is being given to the community.

54-55. The Citizens of Cologne rise against their Elector
        Cologne
        10 August 1581
    Recently it was reported that the citizens of Cologne had held before the town, a prize-shooting in musketry, which the Elector was not minded to sanction. The citizens, however, persisted and it so happened that upon the 4th day of the month the musketeers of His Grace came with divers horses from Neuss and were wishful to proceed to the Priel. The horses were led past far from the town, but the musketeers, about twenty-five to thirty, came across the field close by the town and wanted to see the shooting. The citizens and the contestants however, thought that they had come by order of the Elector to prevent the shooting. A turmoil arose during which one of the Elector’s musketeers was shot dead and eleven were taken prisoner. The alarm was given in the city and the rumour spread among the inhabitants that the Bishop was slaying the burghers and contestants before the gates of the town.Thereupon the inhabitants’ anger was roused and part of the people ran out to the assistance of those whom they believed to be attacked. Apart from this, the populace resolved to inflict much damage upon the clergy. It was most fortunate that the Bishop took no notice of the occurrence, otherwise but few of the richest clerics in the town would have escaped unscathed. Thus often from a small spark a large fire arises. It is hoped that the Elector and the town will make peace.

55-56. Suicide of a Protestant Minister on Account of Bigamy
    unknown
        4 October 1581
    Last Will and Testament of the Magister Johannes Scheerer. He was a Lutheran and was driven out of Nuremberg because he was known to have two wives. According to this his testament, he stabbed himself from despair.
    “Firstly, I have confessed all my sins to God and to my Saviour Jesus Christ, with Whom I shall shortly be, and have with all diligence recited the seven Penitential Psalms.
    “Secondly, I console myself with the words of my Lord Jesus Christ, who said ‘I am the way, the truth and the Life and the Resurrection, he whoever believeth in Me shall live even though he die.’
    “Thirdly, I commit my beloved and devout wife, together with our seven small children to the Holy Trinity, and all holy angels, that they may guard and care for them at all times. I also commend them to the honourable and wise Counsillors in this city, who, I trust, will be their father, in memory of the services of their father, and I leave this world joyously and blissfully. I have taken as my example all the saints who on account of life eternal, have held their bodies here in light esteem and have often jumped into the water or taken other means in order speedily to depart from this life. With peace and happiness I go. Cleobrotus, a heathen, died willingly from desire and joy in eternal life. How much more, then, shall a Christian do likewise?”

        24 October 1581
    On the 19th day of this month, the Elector of Saxony accompanied by his spouse, his son and a young Count Palatine of Zweibrücken arrived here with horses and carriages in fair number. His Imperial Majesty accompanied by as many of his Councillors and courtiers as were present, rode courteously to meet him. As soon as the Elector drew near, both the Emperor and the Elector dismounted from their horses, and the Electress and the young Princes descended from their carriages. They made several steps towards each other and were received by His Majesty in a most friendly manner. But when the Electress desired to re-enter her coach, His Majesty took hold of her in order to assist her. This she in no way desired to permit and so they pursued this show of courtesy for a full quarter of an hour. This caused great mirth to the Elector. Finally, His Majesty desisted and took the Elector and the two young Princes into the coach with him and by the mercy of God drove to the castle of Prague. All were astounded at the most gracious humility displayed by His Imperial Majesty.

All manner of things are said about this marriage, also that our King and his Lady Mother do not view it with displeasure. The French proverb holds good: Jeune folle, vieille enragée.

57-58. Terrifying Apparition in Spain.
        Madrid
        unknown
    In the country of Palamos, in the Kingdom of Catalunia, upon the 1st day of May, the day of the holy Apostles Felipe and Jaime, in the hamlet of Calongo there were seen by all the people a terrifying storm and a huge cloud, in which could be perceived a whole legion of evil spirits of various shapes and most loathsomely deformed. Some were like lions, others like wolves, others again, like dogs, and others like men or wild animals. Many also were like ravens and other black birds. The clergy proceeded to walk with the true cross from the church to the cemetery, in order to exorcize them. But all to no purpose: they paid no heed to it. When the Praepositus saw this, he carried forth the Blessed Sacrament. Then it was seen that most of the spirits rushed into a pond formed by a rivulet two stones’ throw distance from the village. Therefrom presently arose a great flame of fire and smoke, as broad and tall as a veritable belfry, rising to the very clouds. The flame stank most vilely of sulphur. Meanwhile many of the spirits circled like ravens round and round. Among them an especially frightful and terrifying bird. They tore up nine olive-trees, many nut and cherry-trees and also many tufts of grass and earth. One vineyard they burned.
    When it was seen that the storm would not cease, the Praepositus, with the most Blessed Sacrament, ascended to the church belfry, where there was such a violent wind that he fell backwards. The cross fell down from the tower without causing damage.
    From the clouds there fell much water which, however, caused but little harm. The inhabitants of this hamlet having witnessed such a gruesome and frightful occurrence remained in great fear.
    This was reported to the Supreme Council of Spain on the 22nd day of May.

60-63. Marriage of Archduke Ferdinand with the Princess of Mantua
        unknown
        unknown
            background: A short and simple account of what happened at the marriage of His Serene Highness Archduke Ferdinand of Austria with the Archduchess of Mantua.
    On Wednesday, the 9th day of May 1582, the gilt sword and the Archducal hat, which were sent to him by His Holiness the Pope through Franciscus, Bishop of Sebaste, were presented to His Serene Highness by the said Bishop after Mass had been said and the written message of His Holiness had been publicly read before the altar in the new cathedral at Innsbruck.
    On Friday, the 11th day of May, Duke William of Bavaria as the accredited Envoy to these nuptials of His roman Imperial Majesty arrived at Innsbruck in time for the morning meal with his beloved spouse, Maximiliana, sister of his princely grace, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, the two Landgravines of Baden, as well as a considerable number of Court attendants, counts, squires and noblemen, with four hundred horses in all. On the same evening the Archduke Charles of Austria arrived with his beloved Consort and the three princely offspring with a magnificent suite of attendants consisting of privy and trusted Councillors, counts, squires and noblemen, together with five hundred horses. His Serene Highness Archduke Ferdinand with his sons and Duke William of Bavaria came to meet them as far as Hall and accompanied them to Innsbruck. On the following Monday, the 14th day of May, the date of the nuptial ceremony and the entry, Archduke Ferdinand rode beyond the cloister of Wilten, alongside the mountain Isel, with Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria as Imperial Envoy, Archduke Charles of Austria, Cardinal Andreas of Austria and their stately and impressive retinue. Among the courtiers were Count Wilhelm von Zimbern, who entered Innsbruck with forty-one horses, Count Hannibal von Hohenembs, the Counts von Thurn, Schwarzenberg, Liechtenstein, Ortenburg and many other counts, squires and noblemen. From Innsbruck as far as the mountain Isel there lined up five thousand lansquenets and arquebusiers, clad in armour. Several tents had been erected on this spot, among them two which were particularly large. There their Serene Highnesses dismounted and awaited the royal bride, who presently arrived with her mother, the Duchess of Mantua, Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria and the Margrave of Baden. These two Princes had been dispatched on a mission to Mantua with eighty horses to accompany the plighted bride. The members of the Court and the squires of Tyrol had been sent to meet her as far as the frontier below Rovereto. They remained in the other tent opposite that of His Serene Highness until the ninety pieces of heavy ordinance, which had been brought from the armoury, and the arequebusiers had fired. After this was done, Archduke Ferdinand with the above-mentioned princely personages went on foot half way between the two tents in order to greet his beloved promised bride by word of mouth as well as the royal personages who had accompanied her. The Count von Hohenembs welcomed the mother of the bride in the Italian language and Herr Caspar Baron von Wolkenstein made reply and gave thanks.
    Thereupon the entry began. At the head were the whole of the mounted troops and the servitors together with the trumpeters and the army drummers, then followed the counts, squires and nobility, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, both Margraves of Baden and Burgau, Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria, the Prince of Mantua, the Cardinal of Austria, then Archduke Ferdinand. On his right rode the Imperial Envoy, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, on his left Archduke Carl of Austria. Then followed the betrothed Princess with her mother, and a stately retinue of ladies-in-waiting in elegant gilt litters, and carriages on springs. On either side stood the aforesaid soldiery. They rode through three large triumphal arches, fashioned of woodwork and cloth. The first was in front of the Gateway of St. George, where stood eight men holding the coat of arms of the hereditary lands of His Serene Highness, and Latin verses, celebrating the country’s joy at the arrival of their future mistress. The second arch was near the Gate of the Outer City: it was ornamented with an artificial weir and four springing fountains. The third was in the town in the square in front of the Tyrol Chamber with the golden roof. Hereon stood four heroes, and above them twenty-eight boys in gilt clothing with silver bells, and yet above these a band. As soon as the procession had dismounted from the horses, litters and coaches, it wended its way towards the new Imperial Cathedral. There in front of the open church door the Archduke was united with the promised bride by the aforesaid Bishop in canonical robes. The trumpeters blew a joyous blast and vespers were said. The upper church in which stood all the princely wedding guests, was hung with golden ornaments and the whole building with beauteous Dutch tapestries. Hereafter, the sixteen royal wedding guests partook of the evening meal at a table in the golden room. The counts, squires and noblemen, and all the Court and ordinary attendants were served in the inns.
    After the feast, followed dances which were first led by the Archduke Ferdinand, then by the Imperial Envoy and so on according to precedence. Archduke Carl and the Prince of Mantua led the bride as ushers. His Serene Highness and both Margraves danced ahead with torches in their hands. On the15th day of May an elegant and princely joust took place in the lists. All the royal personages, with the exception of the Cardinal appeared in brave raiment and broke their spears on a figure in the presentment of a stag. Archduke Ferdinand received the first prize because he broke the most spears. Although Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria had a fall from his horse, it all passed without mishap, thanks be to God.
    On the 16th day of May, there was held a magnificent tourney on foot in which once more the royal personages and others of eminence took part. They brought into the lists a huge Trojan horse and a castle, together with a fortress made of wood; this which they called the town of Louvain, they attacked and stormed.
    On the 17th day of May, there was a splendid chamois hunt above Innsbruck near Zirl on the St. Martin’s Rock to which came all the royal personages. On the same evening there was held in the Court Garden an exceeding fine artificial display of fireworks with the firing of several large pieces and shooting muskets and fire bullets.
    On the 18th day of May, Archduke Carl, the Duke of Bavaria, the Margrave of Baden, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, together with their princely spouses, ladies-in-waiting and other members of the Court of Innsbruck went by water on their way to Munich.
    So this princely bridal home-coming and nuptials, thanks be to God, passed in beautiful weather, with goodly peace, unity and concord.
    The old Duchess of Mantua with her son, the Prince, are still in Innsbruck.

63-72. Festival of the Circumcision in Constantinople
unknown
        August 1582
            background: Festivities in Constantinople on the Circumcision of Mehemed, son of the Sultan Murad.
    The festivities were fixed for the 2nd day of June 1582, on which day the ceremony in Seraglio which had lasted eight days, came to an end. There the gifts of the Sultanas and other great ladies of the kingdom were presented to the Prince. These gifts consisted of horses, richly-adorned slaves, jewels, garments, and such like. In addition to this, fireworks were burnt day and night for a whole week.
    On the day named, the 2nd day of June, at the Sultan’s command, there assembled in the great Hippodrome all the Pashas, Viziers and the Beglerbeghs of Greece and Anatolia, the Aga of the Janissaries, the Capudan Pasha and other great men of the Realm, together with all the Janissaries. The wax torches destined for the ceremony were about two and a half yards in height and of most unusual thickness. These torches were richly decorated with flowers, gold and silver, and are therefore very heavy. From the Hippodrome the whole gathering proceeded to the Sultan’s Palace. First strode the Khan and other great personages of the Sublime Porte in robes richly embroidered in gold. Then there appeared Mehemed, the son of the great Sultan, on a horse beautifully caparisoned with jewels. The head harness was set with diamonds and a double row of pearls of immense value.
    The youth, who was about sixteen years old, was clad in a richly embroidered coat of green satin. He has an elongated face, pale of colour, his eyes are black and have a serious expression. He greeted the people with lofty gesture. Behind the Prince came six horses, led with halters, with silken saddle clothes, richly embroidered with gold. The ceremonial procession arrived in the Seraglio about the hour of midday. There in accordance with the customs of the country, was made loudly resounding music, on kettledrums, trumpets and other instruments. Then the actual festivities began. There appeared one hundred men with staves, at the end of which were bladders filled with air. They were led by a man who rode a small donkey. With these bladders they struck at the inquisitive assembly in order to drive them off. Then came one hundred Janissaries who had been chosen to guard the seats in the Hippodrome which were destined for the foreign ambassadors. On the first day of the festivities, tight-rope dancers showed their tricks, which they performed with quite amazing skill. Others, again, turned somersaults, which it is impossible either to comprehend or to describe. Also several very skilled spear throwers exhibited their accomplishments for admiration. At night fall an illumination was arranged and this lasted until morning. Four castles filled with fireworks were lighted on the square of the Hippodrome and presented a truly entertaining sight. On the second day there were shown some other clever feats by the tight-rope dancers. There appeared among others a man who allowed a heavy block of marble, on which six men rained blows with hammers, to be placed across his naked belly. Another climbed a very high column placed on a pyramid and performed daring tricks thereon. This man was granted his freedom by His Majesty, and received moreover a gold embroidered robe and a gift of twenty piastres daily for his lifetime. Other jugglers allowed horseshoes to be nailed to their heads. On this day began also the presentation of the gifts from the Great of the Realm and the foreign Ambassadors, which continued day by day. particularly to be mentioned is the Persian Ambassador, who altogether made a brave show. He had arrived with a retinue of two hundred sumptuously clad fellows and witnessed the display in the circus from a box which had been specially erected for him. From behind the grille on their stand, the Chief Sultanas were also able to enjoy the spectacle. In the evening two wooden castled filled with fireworks were set ablaze.
    On the third day various artificially prepared objects were exhibited, among them about three hundred large figures of animals, made of sugar. This lasted until midday, thereafter gifts were presented to all the Ambassadors who had been invited by His Majesty. The Hippodrome was sprinkled by twenty water waggons. A juggler performed there, he hit himself in the face with a stone with all his strength without any harm resulting therefrom. Another executed bold somersaults and was masked. Both were presented with gifts from His Majesty. The Sultan ordered seven thousand flat cakes made out of cooked rice to be brought, also six thousand large loaves of bread and great quantities of mutton. When all this was spread upon the ground, all the poor came rushing in the greatest haste to get hold of the food, and this proved a very entertaining sight. Thereafter was held a hunt of Hungarian boars. In the evening there were once more illuminations and fireworks.
    On the fourth day, other jugglers disported themselves on the aforementioned pyramid on which they performed tricks. On this day the different craftsmen paid homage to the Sultan, among them the weavers of golden shawls worn by the women here on their heads. Then followed three hundred youths from twelve to sixteen in age, in robes worked with gold, who sang songs in praise of the Sultan and his son. This performance pleased the Sultan so much that he gave them a bag with one thousand sequins and ordered them to come to him again the next day. Then there was shown in the Hippodrome a carriage which moved by itself, whilst another to which there were harnessed a horse and a donkey, went up in the air on a tight rope. After this once more gifts of great value were presented. In the evening there took place a feeding of the populace, and four thousand rice cakes, six thousand loaves of bread, and twenty roasted oxen were served on large tables.
    On the fifth day the workers of the Arsenal were entertained. They were given six hundred oxen, a thousand sheep and an immense amount of rice soup. Each worker loaded himself with his potions and betook himself home with it. In the evening there took place the feeding of the populace with bread, mutton and rice. Then came yet another boar hunt and finally illuminations and fireworks.
    On the sixth day there were only entertainments for the people, illuminations and fireworks.
    On the seventh day five thousand Janissaries were regaled in the Hippodrome, together with their Aga. They ate off carpets in six great large galley tents. In the evening there was a feeding of the people and fireworks.
    On the eighth day there were games in the Hippodrome with monkeys, cats, pigs, goats, and such like animals, who performed wondrous tricks. Then came sixty riders in sumptuously ornamented yellow satin robes with breast-plates and morions, who held combat with a hundred and fifty richly attired foot soldiers armed with staves. Then two wooden castles were brought in, in one of which were Christian slaves, who were armed with arquebuses and morions. They also had drums, such as we use. These two castles were stormed the while numerous shots were fired. After this there was a combat between Turkish and Persian warriors and at the finish many riders were thrown out of the saddle with halberd strokes. The Emperor and Ali Pasha were pleased with this spectacle. In the evening the populace was fed again and fireworks were burned.
    On the ninth day the Venetian Ambassador handed over to the Grand Seignior a hundred and fifty gifts from the Venetian Rulers. Among them were four gold embroidered robes and many silken ones. A race with riderless horses was arranged. A juggler danced on a very high platform. He fell from it and was killed. Then a Fox, boar and hare hunt took place. In the evening the people again received victuals and splendid fireworks were burnt which lasted until daylight. The earlier displays were shorter.
    On the tenth day four thousand Spahis with their Aga were entertained. Everything proceeded as at the feast given to the Janissaries, and the Spahis made music. In the evening: feasting of the populace and fireworks.
    On the eleventh day came all their singers, who may be described as mad. They ranged themselves in the market place where the Sultan was, and it was said that they were praying to God for the life of the Sultan. But their method of praying is peculiar and laughable. In the evening fireworks. On this day was seen in the Hippodrome a circus rider, who stood on a horse that was in full gallop. He also sprang from the ground to the galloping horse with great skill. Then the horse stood still and the man sprang on to its back and remained standing there. The horse stood as motionless as though carved in wood. In the evening there was again food for the populace, likewise fireworks. Many loaves of bread were flung among the people from the windows of the palace. The Sultan’s son threw sequins, aspri, and other coins, six thousand sequins’ worth in all, from a window and sixty silver dishes besides. Until 4 o’clock of the morning gorgeous fireworks were burned.
    On the twelfth day the Grand Master of the Artillery was entertained with three thousand gunners. This was carried out in a way like unto that used for the Janissaries and the Spahis. Then there appeared in the Hippodrome a hundred richly dressed horsemen, who fought in Spanish armour. Later they shot with arrows at a disk fastened to a very high pole. They showed great prowess. In the evening the populace was regaled and two galleys and three castles which had been filled with fireworks were burned.
    On the thirteenth day one hundred and seventy richly robed men of the Spinners’ Guild rendered homage to the Sultan. Then fifty mounted archers gave an exhibition. After the feeding of the populace an artificial mountain, erected by the slaves of the Capudan Pasha, in which fireworks were hidden, was set alight. This was not successful. On the other hand, other pieces, such as a giant dressed as a Jew, a dragon, four castles and a ruin made a pleasing spectacle.

They wore robes of cloth with black velvet caps, and were richly adorned with jewels of great price. First came one hundred exquisitely dressed men with glittering spears on their shoulders. Then followed the remaining Periotes and twelve youths who executed dances to the accompaniment of loud music. His Majesty sent them embroidered kerchiefs and four thousand aspri. Then one hundred and fifty armourers did homage, followed by the goldsmiths, then one hundred and fifty cutlers and two hundred tinsmiths. And then followed one after another various guilds of the town with their beautiful and rare handiwork. The master remembered them all with presents of gold. As the populace was being fed that day, the onrush of the poor was so great that more than a half of the food was mangled, and the rest so badly spoiled that not even the dogs would touch it. Nevertheless His Majesty had it proclaimed that he found great pleasure in this, and that the festivities would be prolonged for forty days.

    On the fortieth day there paid homage to the Grand Seignior one thousand Muezzins who made a terrible din with their music. In the evening money was again thrown to the people. At the order of the Sultan the festival was prolonged for a further fourteen days.
    On the forty-first and forty-second days there were banquets for the foreign Ambassadors, rope dancing, equestrian entertainments, feeding of the populace and fireworks.
    On the forty-third day His Majesty went to the baths. He was attended by four Viziers and Mehemed Pasha, who unrobed him. To the latter he presented a dagger set all over with jewels also everything that he wore. His son, whom the Sultan loaded with presents, did likewise.
    On the forty-fourth day there were more festivities but no more great fireworks. From the fortieth day onwards the Ambassadors did not attend the displays, the feeding of the populace was discontinued, and the people began to disperse.
    On the forty-fifth, forty-sixth and forty-seventh days there were tight-rope dancing and fireworks.
    On the forty-eighth day, a tight-rope dancer who carried a man on his back, gave a performance; another man was bound to his legs. The Sultan presented him with a big bag of sequins and a gold embroidered robe. Besides this he assured him of a life-long pension of twenty-five aspri daily, but forbade him in future to risk his life in such a manner.
    On the forty-ninth day, the Zariotes displayed their accomplishments once more.
    On the fiftieth day there were fireworks the whole night long. It was the most beautiful display of all and lasted until the morning.
    On the fifty first day His Majesty returned to the Seraglio of Ibrahim Pasha, and from there to the new Seraglio. And thus ended the festivities.

72-73. Report from India
        unknown
        unknown
            background: Short report which arrived in a letter of the Governor Tellez of Meneses of March last in the year 1581, via the land route.
    One of the mightiest Kings of Oriental India, a neighbour of Portuguese territory, is anxious to become a Christian, as may be learned from letters which arrived from his lands during two consecutive years. It may be regarded as certain that he will now take this step very shortly.
    The Raschu, a very mighty and powerful King, has appropriated nearly the whole kingdom of Ceylon, and laid siege to it for twenty months with a powerful army. The assistance afforded by the Portuguese cost them near on three times one hundred thousand cross ducats and many warriors. But they finally beat the enemy on the day of our dear Lord, the 17th day of February of the year 1581, and a great number of their best fighters fell. They also took from him the larger part of his cannon and other war equipment.
    The King of Dacha, whose kingdom is situate upon the island of Sumatra, has through good luck and assistance gained so considerably in power and reputation that he made the seas unsafe and hoped without help to usurp the power of India. For several years he pursued this plan and His Majesty had decided to send a powerful Armada from Portugal. But this was rendered unnecessary since our Lord God had ordained that the King of Dacha should leave this world through the portals of death. Thereupon great quarrels broke out there and the Governor of India hopes to be able to wage war on this country, which enterprise he will yet undertake within a year.
    The Hidalcar, King of Balayato and lord of the mainland round the town of Goa, died a short while ago. Such disagreements there were between his Captains that the one throttled the other. Thereupon the lord so ordained it that this kingdom has fallen into the hands of a Moor of royal blood, who was brought up in Goa among the Portuguese and received a yearly allowance from them. He has promised to be a good friend and neighbour and to keep free all the harbours, which bring in yearly eight times a hundred thousand ducats, also to grant considerable privileges. A Captain has sailed along the northern coast with ten ships and has ascertained that at Dabul there is a fort belonging to Hidalcar and many ships. Although the enemy hoped to obtain assistance from his own people on land, the Commander, in spite of resistance, pressed them so hard that he killed most of their fighters and took away ten ships without their getting any help.

73. Arrival of the Indian Fleet in Lisbon
        Lisbon
        30 July 1582
    In Lisbon there has arrived a ship from India of the name of Buen Jesus. She brings five thousand five hundred quintals of pepper, two thousand of cloves, much cinnamon and other spices. She started upon the 23rd day of January and lay thirteen days off the island of St. Helena. From thence she sailed on the 11th day. In India two more ships lay at the loading station, they are said to be bringing about sixteen thousand quintals of pepper, six thousand quintals of cloves and one thousand quintals of cinnamon and other spices. May God grant them safe arrival.

73-74. Procession in Lisbon
        Lisbon
        3 September 1582
    Yesterday, the 2nd day of the month, the merchants and the plateros held in the new street here a procession with the German merchants. They started from the Church of St. John with the Holy Sacrament and the procession was so stately and magnificent that I have never seen nor shall I see its like elsewhere. The whole Bible from the creation of the world to our Redemption was presented by figures and by living persons clad in rich garments of brocade and silk, most graceful and chaste, accompanied moreover by three triumphal chariots. As I am informed, this has cost over one hundred thousand scudi not counting the jewelry and the ornaments with which all these persons were adorned. Even their shoes are said to be worth an incredible sum; some aver more than a million in gold.
    They made this sumptuous display because His Majesty, with the Empress and the whole Court watched the pageant from their palace: but it rained considerably. Much could be written, but I hope to receive a report on this and to send it on to you. These processions only take place once in several years, and for this reason they are arranged in so splendid a manner. The mouths of the Spanish soldiers watered much for the jewels, and they wish for nothing better than that there should some day come an opportunity for plunder. No one imagined that the Portuguese owned such riches and treasures, nor that they were clever enough to display them in such stately fashion.

74. The Burning of the Exchange in Antwerp
        Antwerp
        26 February 1583
    Upon the evening of the 23rd day, at 9 o’clock, the Exchange here was burnt to the ground. This fire was caused by a brazier, and many of the merchants thus lost all their possessions. Otherwise, thanks to God, no damage was done to any of the other houses.

74-75. Driving out of Devils in Vienna
        Vienna
        3 September 1583 of the old calendar.
            background: Copy of a letter of the Arbogast Nachtrube.
    The Jesuits here, two weeks ago, in company of the Bishop drove out a devil from a poor maid. Her mother is a witch and lies still in jail. First it was all of no avail, but finally she was given a drink of holy water. She had not long partaken of this before Satan left her.
    As I had completed this letter, there arrives a courier from Constantinople and reports that Herr Frederick Breuner, the Ambassador of His Imperial Majesty, has died there.

75. Arrival of the Indian Gold Fleet
        Madrid
        26 September 1583
    The fleet from Spanish India, praise be to God, arrived upon the 13th day of this month without mishap. It carries a shipment of about fifteen millions.It is said that they unloaded and left a million in Havanna, because the ships were too heavily laden. This is a pretty penny, which will give new life to commerce.

75. The Plague in Prague
        Vienna
        15 October 1583
    Rumour has it that His Imperial Majesty will again shortly come here, because the plague has spread, not only in Prague itself, but also on the outskirts, so that His Majesty knows of no safe place for his Court. The aforementioned contagious disease is on the increase here also, and up to four-and-twenty persons succumb daily of the plague, wherefore amongst other measures it was ordered to close the public baths.
    Concerning the Papal Calendar, practically no one takes any heed of it. Neither has His Majesty decreed that it should be observed, but he has merely announced that this should be done because, in fulfilling the Pope’s injuction and request, His Majesty was but rendering a service unto him.

75-76. The Murder of William of Orange
        Antwerp
        16 July 1584
    In the evening—the 12th of this month—we received the news, the truth of which was later confirmed, that on the 10th day of this month, the Prince of Orange was murdered in Delft, by a Burgundian, one named Bartholomew Gerard. The latter had on the day previous been dispatched from France as messenger to the Diet, and to the Prince of Orange, to report on the death of the Duke of Alençon. And a quarter of an hour after his arrival, the Prince no longer lived. As I write this, there comes the news that the said Bartholomew Gerard has been tortured at Delft, and has confessed that he was persuaded in Italy by a Jesuit, in the name of the King of Spain, to kill the Prince of Orange. The Jesuit had promised him thirty thousand pounds for the deed. Should he, however, be discovered in the act and lose his life, his friends were to receive the money. Thereupon he was sent by the said Jesuit to Paris to the Ambassador of the King of Spain there, one named Taxis. The latter sent him to the Queen Mother of France, who gave him letters to the Prince of Orange and the Diet in Holland, to announce that her son, the Duke of Alençon, had departed this life. Before he came to Holland, he went to the Prince of Parma, to whom he communicated his plan. Not until after this did he appear before the Prince of Orange.

76-77. Pomp at the Paris Court
        Paris
        11 January 1585
    Much might be written about the new Court Regulations, but it would please me more could I see something that might prove helpful towards the payment of debts. At the beginning of the new year, the grooms of the chamber, the cooks, doorkeepers, and all the lesser menials have been clad in damask, and a golden chain hung round their necks, even to the ushers. For the Gentlemen of the Council there were manufactured brown velvet robes and mantles trimmed with braid and lined with satin. For the Chancellor there was made a red velvet coat, and peculiar cloaks in velvet for the Secretaries of State. These are kept in a special closet of the palace. There the said gentlemen don them when they go to the Council in the mornings; but they doff these garments after they leave.

77-78. Nuptials at the Court of Philip II
        Saragossa
        12 March 1585
    Yesterday at 4 o’clock, the Duke of Savoy arrived here. The King rode out beyond the river to meet him and received him in most gracious fashion. He allowed him to make his entry on horseback at his right hand. This the Duke would not have at first, but he was forced to consent for His Majesty so wished it. The Spaniards were not a little astonished at this. To-day at 12 o’clock the Church Ceremony took place, whereafter the King dined in public with the Duke, the bride and the eldest Infanta. This evening a dance will be held, and thereafter the marriage will be consummated. The bride looked on this day mightily morose. I know not, whether perhaps she is dissatisfied with the appearance of the Duke, who is small and ugly. If this be the case, she may, after the dance of this night, conceive a better liking for the bridegroom to-morrow.
    The Duke of Savoy arrived in such state that the inhabitants were astonished thereat. First there came riding in front one hundred postilions, all attired in yellow cloth, then came the aposentadores in beautiful liveries, and then the servants of the postmaster also in livery. Then there rose over two hundred Savoyard followers, clad in yellow velvet. Then with the Duke there came a hundred stately gentlemen and cavaliers, all robed alike in violet coloured velvet. The velvet of the cavaliers was nearly covered with gold and silver lace. Among the many gentlemen of high rank there are the eldest son of the Duke of Nemours from France, stately and opulent marquises, earls and knights, so that the Duke has won a great reputation among Spaniards.
    As this letter has been delayed for a day, there is something else I should like to add that has taken place meanwhile. This is that yesternight we looked on at the dance which lasted until 11 o’clock. What happened later at the consummation of the marriage, the bride will know. To-day neither the bride nor the bridegroom have been seen. On the 21st day of this month a tourney will be held, that we must await, though our stay is burdened with heavy expense. This evening the cavaliers from Arragon will hold a hunt and break lances.
            Saragossa, 18 March
    From my last writings you will know what has happened here. Since then naught of particular interest has come to pass. The Duke of Savoy wished to play the Pelota with the people he had brought with him against the local gentry. But this the King refused to allow. Although there has fallen a fair amount of rain during these days, His Majesty has twice or thrice ridden to various churches. The Gentlemen of the Court, and the grandees, and the arragonesque cavaliers of this town wish to hold jousts on horseback on the coming Thursday. Three or four days later the Castilians want to hold a similar tourney on foot, and a hunt as well.
    The King is to leave here on the 27th or 28th, some say for Barcelona, others for Montserrat in order to pass Holy Week there with the Duke and his retinue. Where and when the Cortes will be held, no one knows for certain. There are so many surmises and opinions that there is nothing to write about.Time will show.

78-79. The Siege of Antwerp
        Antwerp
        15 March 1585
    On the 12th day of this month the Corporation called together all the guilds and desired that the burghers should advance money in cash for the sustenance of the troops here and should state how much food, wine and beer each company consumes. The money is not to be returned until our river has been freed from the enemy’s occupation and our district is opened up once more. Thereupon they determined to deliberate upon this. With regard to our waterway, it remains as before. Means are lacking for reopening it, although various preparations to free it are being made. This, however, is held by many to be nothing but mockery and procrastination.

79. Death of Pope Gregory XIII
        Venice
        14 April 1585
        background: through the Antwerp courier
    Well born and gracious Sir,
    Up to the evening of the day before yesterday, everything that was needful had been reported to you, but as to-day we have an opportunity to send this to you, we would inform you that His Holiness the Pope died in the Lord, on the 10th day of this month at 12 o’clock. May the Almighty be merciful to his soul. Within the space of ten hours he was first in good health, then ill, then dead, suffocated by a catarrh. Farnese shows no elation and all those who were sick abed were made to rise through this shock. One lays twenty-five percent. on Farnese being chosen Pope, thirteen on Savelli, on Sancto Severina eight, on Fachinetti six, and on Mondovi five. One lays thirty per cent. on the Pope’s election taking place before the last of May.

79. Persecution of the Huguenots in Marseilles
        Marseilles
        16 April 1585
    This town has been in sore tribulation and was to have been plundered on Palm Sunday, moreover the throats of all the Huguenots were to be cut. But from this God Almighty preserved us. The second Consul wished to carry out with the Captain the plan to make themselves masters of the town. They thrust many of the Reformed Religion into prison and gave the people to understand that this was done at the King’s command. Thereby they embittered the commoners and made them rebellious. On the 10th day of this month at 10 o’clock at night the Consul together with the Captain went to the house of General Cabané, who belongs to the Reformed Religion, presented him with a letter in which nothing was written and immediately thereon massacred him in his house. Thereafter they went to other Huguenots, dragged them from their beds and led them out to the Tower of St. Felician. Others they bound by one thigh and dragged alive through the town up a certain mountain. There they inflicted upon them divers stabs and threw them naked into the sea. On this account the most noble houses here have armed themselves and insisted that the Consul should show them the King’s commands in the Town Hall. But he made answer that his instructions were not to be shown to all and sundry. The Captain who was the brother of the aforesaid Cabané was taken prisoner. He himself did kill his brother because Cabané had no children. The Grand Prior from Aix was promptly sent for and arrived in the night with one hundred well-equipped horsemen. He went immediately to the prisons and freed the poor prisoners who fell at his feet and thanked him profusely. Then he examined the imprisoned Consul and the Captain and had them hanged on the gallows at night between the eleventh and twelfth hour. Yesterday their heads were severed from their bodies, but in four pieces and displayed in the streets. The Consul’s head was impaled on a high staff in front of the Porte Royale and that of the Captain in front of his brother’s house.

79-80. Attempt to Relieve the Besieged of Antwerp
        Cologne
        6 June 1585
    On the 21st day of May in the night those of Antwerp made fast, one to another, sixteen large and small shallow ships, which were equipped with large, strong-wrought grappling irons in front and underneath. These they sent with full sails and with a mighty wind against the rafts in front of the Palisade. They rammed them so hard that all the anchors broke and that the ships, together with the rafts, came near unto the Palisade. There they stopped. Thereupon four other ships, which were loaded with powder, iron chains, large grave-stones, and millstones followed, in order to burst up the Palisade completely. The first of these blew up into the air a short distance from the Palisade, without causing any damage. The second was driven ashore and left lying in the sand. She also blew up but caused much havoc. The third ship came near to the palisade with a strong wind and at full speed. The Spaniards immediately loosened two ships from the Palisade and let her through. She also exploded at pistol range without any harm being done. But the fourth and largest ship on which those of Antwerp had built all their hopes, was boarded by four sailors who were supposed to be willing to sacrifice their lives for the welfare of their King and Country. They, however, threw away the quickmatch, cut down the sails and steered the ship ashore, afterwards unloading her. They took therefrom a hundred small barrels of gunpowder. Of these the Prince of Parma made them a gift, as well as of the ship and all that was therein, together with his commendation. Thereupon the Armada left Holland and Zeeland for the dikes, but upon seeing that the Spaniards were holding them strongly garrisoned, went back below Lillo.

80-82. A False Don Sebastian
        Lisbon
        15 June 1585
    Upon the 12th day of this month our new self-styled King, Don Sebastian, was brought hither, and yesterday at noon was led through the town riding on a donkey; his right hand was cut off, whereafter he was hanged and quartered. To-day two of his accomplices were hanged. This Don Sebastian has publicly confessed that his name was Matheo Perez, and that he was persuaded to such an action through the tempting of the arch-enemy and by several people. His father and he were stone-masons. His effrontery went so far that he deceived many peasants less than a mile from here, by making them believe that he was Don Sebastian. On Tuesday, he had himself proclaimed King in five places to the ringing of bells, he distributed official posts, killed sundry people and plundered their houses. He collected eight hundred peasants and it was feared that a rebellion might ensue. But three hundred soldiers were promptly dispatched thither, who dispersed the peasants and hanged some of them. Others fled into the mountains. This disturbance was, no doubt, instigated by Don Antonio, who was to have assisted with the fleet, which he had collected in France. Yesterday, a Frenchman carrying letters was taken prisoner. Other peasants will be arrested day by day, and it is imperative that the Portuguese should not be trusted in future.

82. The Taking of Antwerp
        Antwerp
        21 August 1585
    On the 17th day of this month the treaty of the handing over of this city was concluded and on the 20th day of this month it was read and made public. No particular joy nor jubilation on account thereof was manifested by the populace; only the Italians and some Catholics burnt bonfires. The Town Council made but little ado about the reading. Everything is quiet here. The troops display inexpressible home-sickness; the reformed preachers will these days travel by ship to Holland and Zeeland. Nothing has as yet been seen of the waggons with provisions, wine, and beer, which, according to rumour, are said to be in the camp. In the Parma’s camp wine costs half a thaler the pint. According to information given out here, the Prince of Parma is not to enter until the 1st day of September, which is his birthday. It is said that he has kept for this occasion a special favour not included in the treaty, which he will bestow upon the town. It will then be seen with what affection he regards it.

83-84. Gifts for the Sultan
        Constantinople
        2 October 1585

84. The Expulsion of the Huguenots
        Paris
        18 October 1585
    The day before yesterday a new edict was proclaimed which threatens all Huguenots in France with pain of death and the loss of their goods and chattels if they do not leave the country within fifteen days. But women and children are allowed to remain until six months have elapsed from the first édit de réunion. This edict is particularly directed against those who are fighting. Their goods will be sold from the very hour it appeared and the proceeds employed for the maintenance of the royal troops.

84. A Sorry Week in Augsburg
        Augsburg
        2 December 1585
    The week just passed has been an unhappy one, for on Monday a carman hanged himself, kneeling. On Tuesday a goldsmith of the name of Ostwald, sprang into the Lech in the Sachsengässlein, wishing to drown himself on account of debts. But his neighbours saved him. On the night of Thursday, a cloth-shearer of the name of Huber who was drunk, fell into the Lech and was drowned. His body was found the next day. On the same day a peasant woman of Pfersen killed a young male child—her own flesh and blood. On Friday a fisherman, who is also a gardener in Pfersen, persuaded his betrothed to accompany him to another village, because there would be holiday there two days running. When she had agreed to this and they were a little way from the town, he stabbed her seven times with a crooked blade and sorely wounded her. As several persons saw this murder from afar and raised a great clamour, the malefactor took flight towards the city. The keeper of the gate caught the miscreant and by order of the authorities he has been thrown into prison. The wounded girl was carried to the Pilgrim’s House, where she yet lies in a hopeless state. Last night a weaver of the town was stabbed to death, on account of which the small gates have remained closed this day. In the past night also, a miller in the upper town threw his wife into the river and tried to drown her. But people came to her assistance.

85. Defeat of the Turks in Persia
        Venice
        20 December 1585
    Now at the close of this letter the Government receives tidings from its Ambassador in Constantinople that the Persian Sophi and his son allowed the Turks to push forward deep into the country as far as Tabriz. When they had arrived there, the father and the son surrounded the Turks and vanquished them, taking prisoner those who were not killed. The General of the Turks, Osman Pasha, together with two of the most distinguished Pashas perished. Of the Turks close on a hundred thousand men were left for dead, also a goodly number of the Persians, for the battled raged two days and three nights. Nevertheless the Persians achieved victory.

85-89. The Murder of the Signora Accaramboni
        Padua
        22 December 1585
            background: New tidings of a pitiful act of murder at Padua in Italy, a townbelonging to the Venetian rulers.
    The Duke Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, scion of one of the noblest Roman families had for wife the sister of the now reigning Grand Duke of Florence, with whom he has as issue of the marriage-bed a young Prince of the name of Giovanni. But as the said Prince had but little sexual intercourse with the former Duchess of Florence, he was induced by fleshly desire to break his marriage vows.
    He conceived a burning passion for the wife of the nephew of the now reigning Pope Sixtus. But she did not wish to turn unfaithful to her husband, and therefore told him that she was married and that no other man should approach her. Thereupon the said Duke forgot himself and had the husband of the lady (the nephew of the Pope) horribly murdered. He then once more approached the widow of the murdered man. But she curtly refused him because he was married and she a widow and not wishful to do such a thing. Thereupon the Prince Paolo Giordano forgot himself still further and had his own spouse, sister of the present Duke of France, put out of the way, in order to still his concupiscence for the above-named widow. Then, for the third time he paid his addresses to her. This time she made subjection to him but only on condition that he married her, which he did.
    Meanwhile the Cardinal, the present Pope, did not rest in his desire to avenge the innocent blood of his nephew. But as he was not of much consideration, he has been placated. However, when he became Pope, the Duke wished to be reconciled with him. He knelt before him and begged for his blessing. Thereupon the Pope said: “Duke Paolo Giordano, you insulted the Cardinal Montalto; but Pope Sixtus pardons you. Do not come again, however, of that we warn you." The Duke was greatly alarmed at this speech and removed himself with his spouse to Padua, in Venetian territory, where he kept Court and had up to five hundred persons at his board. Nevertheless, before two months had passed, he died at Salo. Foul play was suspected. He left his spouse, who belonged to the noble Roman house of Accaramboni, a large property. The Grand Duke of Florence was by no means pleased with this testament, and took charge of the young forsaken Prince Giovanni, calling upon the widow at the same time to put aside the will. Should she marry again, he would deal handsomely by her; but he urged upon her to enter a convent or to remain a widow. Then also would he make handsome provision for her. But to this she would not agree, and wished to abide by the testament and to keep a retinue of one hundred persons. On the 22nd day of this month, at 2 o’clock at night, according to Italian time, her palace in Padua was found open. Fifty well-armed men thereupon entered and cruelly shot the brother of the Signora Accaramboni, a certain Duke Flaminio; as to the lady, they stabbed her where they found her at prayer. Although she pitifully entreated that she might be permitted first to conclude her orisons, the murderers fulfilled their deed. The most distinguished among them is Ludovico Orsini, the first chief of the Government here, cousin of the dead Paolo Giordano. Therefore he entrenched himself with his assassins in his house. In the meanwhile the news was brought here and the Government has dispatched one of its Senators to Padua with authority to destroy the house of Orsini and to take the murderers alive or dead. The said Orsini surrendered himself with a dagger in his hand, and his house was fired upon from several large cannon. Thereby a number of his retainers perished, the remainder being taken prisoner.
            Venice, 27 December 1585
    Yesterday the Government here decided that the Colonel Ludovico Orsini was to be strangled three hours after the delivery of their letter. His accomplices were to be dealt with according to their deserts. Without doubt they will be hanged and quartered.
    The chief culprit Orsini confessed that he had perpetrated this murderous deed at the command of great personages. The students in Padua have armed themselves and cried out “Justice, Justice!”
            Venice, 1 January 1586
    It has been recently reported that the Colonel of this Government, Ludovico Orsini, acted murderously and with his own hand slew in gruesome fashion the wife of the late Prince Paolo Giordano, Duke of Bracciano, and her brother, Duke Flaminio.
    When the decision that he must die within three hours was made known to Ludovico Orsini, he confessed that although his years numbered but four-and-thirty, he had put to death with his own hands forty persons, believing that Justice would never lay hands upon him because he belonged to so illustrious a house. He had hoped likewise that he would not be publicly executed. But when he was informed that he was not to be strangled in a public place but in a chamber, he gave thanks for this judgment and penned two letters, one to his spouse and the other to the Government here. He commended to the latter’s care his spouse and child, as well as his estate, so that they might not suffer on his account. He also made a will by which be bequeathed to the Government his armour, worth over and above six thousand crowns. The remainder of his property he left to his wife, who was at the time with child.
    He gave fifty crowns to his executioner, in order that he might be dispatched quickly.
    The brother of this Ludovico Orsini, Don Latino Orsini, is Governor of Candia under the Venetian rule. But shortly afterwards the Government sent a frigate to divest him of the command because they no longer put faith in him. And just as high as the house of Orsini had stood in esteem, as deep is now its fall.
    After Ludovico Orsini had been strangled, his body was borne to the cathedral, the coffin decorated with tapestries and left lying there through the whole of this the 27th day of December. Then it was brought hither and interred in the Church of the Madonna dell’ Orto, where Don Giordano and Don Valerio Orsini, the forbears of Ludovico, also lie buried.
    The murdered Signora Accaramboni was a woman of great eloquence for as Ludovico Orsini was about to murder her, she was at prayer, and when the murderer said to her:
    “Do you recognize me?” she made answer “Yea, now it is time to prepare my soul. I beg of you by the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to let me make my confession and then do with me as you please." “Nay,” answered the enemy, “now is not the time for confession.”
    In Padua near on six hundred burghers paraded in arms and cried “Justice, Justice!”  Now follows the list of those who were publicly executed: Count Paganello Ubaldi and Captain Splandiano da Fermo. These two were the servants of the urdered lady, who did open her dwelling—the palace—and who were accomplices in the bloody deed. They were riven asunder with red-hot tongs, and killed with a hammer and then quartered. Buglion and Furio Savognano, two noblemen and secret advisers of Ludovico Orsini have been secretly strangled.
    Agrippa Tartaro de Monte Falco, the Comte de Camerion and thirteen more, some of them nobles, others arrant scoundrels, were all hanged.
    Colonel Lorenzo Nobile del Borgo, Liverotto, and da Fermo were torn to pieces by the mob as they were firing upon the house. Twenty of the people lie imprisoned. they also will probably be hanged.

89-93. The Plundering of Santo Domingo
unknown
        11 January 1586
        background: Report of the capture and pillage of Santo Domingo on the island of Spagnola by the English pirate Francis Drake; this report was forwarded to the Royal Council for India.
    On the 11th day of January of this year, a mighty Armada, belonging to the Queen of England was to be seen lying before this town and harbour, composed of thirty large and seventeen small ships, which had already been sighted from afar on the previous day towards noon. Their Commander was Francis Drake. The fleet took its course to the south. Thereupon there arose much disquiet in the town, and forthwith the President and the Councillors foregathered with the burghers and the citizens, in great concern, in order to decide upon measures for self-defence. These they have taken on the coast at the place where a landing of the enemy was to be feared. They sank many barrels filled with sand into the river and behind them ranged four hundred men so that they could shoot at the enemy with their muskets. On land they erected earth works. They supplied the first with a parapet and cannon. In Cabia, half a mile from the town, troops were stationed in order that they should keep watch and check the enemy, should this become necessary. The President and the Councillors also called together the most experienced burghers, to ask them whether in their opinion the enemy could land at any other spot and do damage.
    They were assured with one accord that, with the exception of Cabia, there was no landing-place on the whole coast. As now there was no longer fear on that score, all resistance was directed towards the river, as many mighty ships had been seen sailing towards it. Besides those mentioned heretofore, three others came quite near, seeking a favourable opportunity of attack. Meanwhile the other ships sailed hither and thither, keeping them selves well out of range of the cannon shot from the fort. They were recognized as enemies and fired upon, but the powder was worthless and the projectiles failed to reach them. It can be imagined that disquiet arose through the menace of the enemy. The authorities rested not a moment throughout the night, but were continually on the alert, so as to keep all in good order. They noticed that the populace had begun to leave the town, in order to flee from the designs and wrath of the enemy, and to save their wives, children and goods. This they did, although it was forbidden on pain of death. Thereupon came the news that a great number of the enemy were approaching the town, and were about half a mile from it. They had landed three miles from here at a place where to do so was thought to be quite impossible. All in all there were only about one hundred and twenty men on horse and on foot left to take into battle, in order to make as good a stand as possible against the enemy. The chief Captain of this handful were: the Licentiate Juan Fernandes de Mercado, the Licentiate Balthasar de Villa Fane, the local Auditor of the Royal Council and with them was the Fiscal Licentiate Aliago. The President, as General, accompanied by these gentlemen, and also the Licentiate Arero, who belonged to the Council, marched out at the head of the above-mentioned troop. They went close on quarter of a mile to meet the enemy. The President and also the other gentlemen were on horseback, armed with spears and shields, with them was also Don Diego Orsinio, the Captain of the galley, which His Majesty had here. This galley at the time was on shore for repairs, so that she was useless. As they drew near to the enemy, the President and his horse sank into the bog, so that steed and man were covered with mud, in full view of the troops. This was held to be of ill-omen. Thereupon the President betook himself back to his dwelling. He was urged to do this, for owing to his age and infirmities his ability to wage war had departed. He was accompanied by the venerable Licentiate Arero. The remainder of those heretofore mentioned took the leadership and are highly to be honoured for their bravery and stout-heatedness. They are worthy of great favours to be bestowed upon them by His Majesty. All the more so if victory had been granted to our side. With courageous spirit they offered their lives to the enemy although they were well aware of his great strength, nigh on seven hundred.
    These were well armed. They were mostly musketeers, archers, and arquebusiers, also spearmen and halberdiers. Furthermore, there were another six thousand men in the ships. The enemy had divided into three groups and waited for our troops. But when the latter perceived the power and strength of their opponents they were filled with fear. Therefore the Licentiate Balthasar, who showed a brave spirit during this expedition and wished to do credit to his office, gave the soldiers a Christian admonition, exhorted them to be brave and stout of heart, challenged them to the fray and approached the enemy within bullet range.
    The Licentiate Mercado also showed that his spirit was no whit less ardent or brave. These two and others of the nobility took up front positions and went into danger in order to induce the rest to follow them, but instead of so doing they broke into flight, heedless of all admonitions and penalties with which the Licentiate Balthasar was threatening them. He called out to them to turn back and to attack and face at least two discharges of bullets, taking no heed of who fell. He wished that God and the whole world should see that they had done their duty. But this was of no avail and they all retreated. The nobles and the Councillos remained behind exposed to all the danger of the shots which were fired from the ships, whose prows were directed against the rear-guard. They re-entered the town through the Gate of Zemba, through which they had passed out. From there they fired three cannon at the enemy and laid low two or three of their men. Now that there was no longer any resistance, the town and harbour were given over to the enemy, who took possession thereof. The fort, too, had no chance of defending itself. They plundered the town from one end to another and took all the private property including that of the nobility, in order to avoid giving cause for offence to the ordinary citizens. The Licentiate Villa Fane is worthy of great compassion, for nothing remained to him. When he was told that he ought to save his belongings as the others had done, he refused to do this, and said that as his property remained here, here would he also die.
    Then the enemy set fire to the town. When a goodly portion of it was burnt, a remedy was found to save at least the churches and what remained. Five-and-twenty thousand thalers were then given to the enemy. When they had received this sum they withdrew on the 10th day this month of February after they had been five weeks in the town, which they left without guns and defenceless. Those galleys and ships which they did not take with them, they burned. Their vessels were loaded with the bells from all the churches and cloisters. Of these have been destroyed and burned: St. Domingo, St. Francisco, the Church of the Mother of God, Santa Clara, Regina Angelorum. These are left in such a state that neither monk nor nun can abide in them. Without the grace of God and help and assistance from the King they will not be able to hold this land under discipline. They also so burned the Church of St. Barbara, that it is now a sorry sight. They then destroyed, burnt and barbarously profaned the pictures of God and His saints. Nothing remains but life itself, which has to be spent in great poverty. The distress is great, and the worst of all that the island is in such bad condition that only a very feeble resistance will be offered to enemy ships. The populace is affrighted and in a dangerous temper. Would that His Majesty took pity on us and showed his authority, for it was for his sake in the first place that this new world was discovered. To keep two galleys for the protection of this island is not enough. It has pleased god, our Lord, thus to confuse the enemy’s brains that they did not press further onwards and destroy the land and its inhabitants.
    All this time the Councillors have kept round the town some two hundred men who troubled the enemy by day and night, killing some of their people without loss on our side, and making it impossible for them to press further.
    The enemy brought with them a parson of the Lutheran Faith in order that he should proselytize. When two preaching monks opposed this, they were imprisoned, hanged and died martyrs. Given in Santo Domingo on the 20th day of February 1586.

93-94. Bad Times in New Spain
        Mexico
        15 March 1586
           background: News-letter.
    Yesterday the ship from New Spain, which left there upon the 1st day of March, arrived here. On the 25th day of February a ship with three hundred men and all manner of munitions sailed for Havana to render assistance. Those who have landed here previously from Havana, report that the country is ruined and that there is no demand for merchandise. They were obliged to take off twenty per cent. and to give long credit for the little that was sold. A ship brings nine hundred arobas of cochineal as counter cargo. Different reports are current about the arrival of the fleet. Some say yea, the others nay. Whether it comes or not, it will bring but little money back, for no one will wish to spend because the goods are worth more in Spain than here. What is sold here will have to be given on credit. He who has sailed for Havana with the said three hundred men, writes that he has learnt for certain that the English pirates have gone to Honduras and there taken possession of the Porto Canaros, which is the most important port there. They have also taken away the ships among which was one containing three hundred loads of cargo. It is held for a certainty that the pirates will also go to Campeche and visit the whole coast. They will also make a stay in order to see whether it is possible to capture the fleet from New Spain. On this account it is feared that it will not be able to venture forth. This is all that is known. It is the most deplorable tidings for commerce that can be imagined. Our Armada, likewise, does not hurry. It is written to us that our Viceroy of Peru lies in Truxillo near unto death.

94. The Spaniards Establish Themselves in the Red Sea
        Constantinople
        15 June 1586
    On the 14th day of this month two galleys arrived here from Alexandria, bringing news that the Armada of the King of Spain of about seventy large and small ships, has arrived from India, through the Persian Gulf, near Aden, a three days’ journey from Suez. They have diligently examined everything there and appear desirous to build a large fortress near Aden, on African soil, and hereby to cut off the Turks from Indian navigation.

95. The Plague in Constantinople
        Constantinople
        25 June 1586
    The plague has—said to relate—broken out again so severely that already about one hundred persons have perished in the Seraglio of the Ibrahim Vesier Pasha. Also it has made so grievous a beginning in all the out-lying places that it is feared—which God forbid—that a far more serious pestilence is in store than that of the year 1584. All flee from the town. The Sultan has had a place of refuge erected for him on the Black Sea, whither he will repair in about eight or ten days with his whole family. I am again hiring the garden in Asia, above Scutari, which I had in the year 1584, and am ready on the day after to-morrow to travel there again by the grace of God with those of my family whom He has spared to me and who at this moment are all cheerful and healthy. I shall thus protect myself as far as is possible with God’s help from the infection and evil air.

95-96. Proceedings against Count Kinsky
        Prague
        23 December 1586
    Here everything is as of old, except that Herr Kinsky had to appear on the 18th day of December in the Diet before His Imperial Majesty and his officers, in order to crave publicly His Imperial Majesty’s grace and pardon. It took place in this manner. His Imperial Majesty came out of his chamber, seated himself in the royal chair and ordered the officers to take their places also. Then Herr Kinsky stepped to the barrier and spoke more or less as follows: He begged His Imperial Majesty, as his most gracious King and Lord, through his Imperial mercy to withdraw the proceedings against him. If he had sinned against His Imperial majesty, would His Majesty assign it more to his imprudence than to any intention to detract from the reputation and the augustness of His Majesty. Therefore, he besought His Majesty graciously to pardon him for the love of God.
    When this had taken place, His Majesty called together his Councillors and conveyed the following to Kinsky by Herr von Rosenberg. His Majesty had certainly been willing to allow Justice to take its course, but, as he had so humbly begged His Majesty for mercy and because other petitions had also been presented His Majesty would be merciful to him. The conditions of the pardon should be made known to him. Thereafter Kinsky stepped once more to the barrier, knelt down and repeated the above words. Then the King called to him and extended his hand; with this, the pitiful spectacle came to an end. It was grievous to see such an old man, of so great a merit, and one known and respected in all parts, in such sorry plight. It must indeed have been no small grief to him. May God protect him. I only fear that he may lose his post. In short: it is not wise to joke with the Great, for they have long arms, and one must not open one’s mouth too wide.
    Post scripta: Since writing the above, the conditions for the pardon were made known to Herr Kinsky. He must relinquish of his own accord the office of Burgrave of Karlstein, and the twenty thousand florins which he had with His Majesty are to be forfeit.

96. Sentence of Death against Mary Stuart
unknown
        27 December 1586
    In letters from London it is written that Parliament has condemned the Queen of Scotland to be executed by the sword. But the Queen of England will not suffer this. The King of France has dispatched Monsieur de Belliève to the Queen of England, earnestly to beseech her to spare the life of the Queen of Scotland. How this matter will further develop is awaited with anxiety.

97-105. Execution of Mary Stuart
unknown
        18 February 1587
            background: Exhaustive report of the way in which Queen Mary Stuart of Scotland and Douairière of France was beheaded on the 18 February of the new calendar, in the castle of Fotheringhay in England.
    After there had been revealed to the Queen of England, Elizabeth, several plots, hatched at the instigation of the Pope and the heads of the neighbouring states, enemies of the Crown of England, the said Queen found that she had not only to fear for her throne, but also for her life. She then realized that their aim was to release the Queen Mary of Scotland from her durance and to establish her as the next heir, although she was a Catholic and had been detained in prison in England for many years. In this prison she was persecuted for a long time by the parliament and the States of the Scottish Kingdom, in order that she might be condemned to death, for she had murdered a king, and had set fire to a house with gunpowder, because she was in love with Bothwell, a Scottish baron. Thereupon she abdicated in favour of her son James, the present King of Scotland. But when she again escaped from prison, she assembled troops, so as to rob the said son of his crown. However she was put to flight and returned again to England. In spite of these charges Queen Elizabeth yet desired to spare her life, not wishing to be her judge, on account of her being such a near blood relation.
    But as the Scottish Queen now presumed to covet the Crown of England, the English Queen could not let her go free and scathless, because her life, her country and religion were imperilled. Also she did not wish to create any suspicion in the minds of the Scots. Although the Scottish Queen was kept in such lax and pleasurable confinement that she could even go hunting and enjoy all the pleasures of the chase, she, nevertheless, did not rest content with the pastimes that were allowed to her. She tried many and various devices to become free again, namely through encompassing the death of the Queen of England. to this end she enticed many persons of the nobility, among them the Duke of Norfolk, as well as other earls and gentlemen, so that the Queen of England was to have lost her life at her Court in the previous summer. On that account the above-named lords met a miserable end. Also England was to have been attacked by foreign troops, the Scottish Queen set upon the thrones of Scotland and England, and the Romish faith established in both kingdoms. All of this the Queen of England gathered from various informants, and the Queen of Scotland was proved guilty in the presence of the nobility, the knighthood and the officials.
    It was discussed in parliament and by the States, how the person of the Queen and the religion of the country could be guarded in future against such dangers. As, however, the Scottish Queen was a close blood relation, her life was to be spared. Since also she was not in the free enjoyment of her liberty and rights, a sentence of death would make a rare and amazing departure.
    Thereupon Parliament decided thus:--the life of the Scottish Queen would mean the death of the English Queen and the ruin and destruction of England and of her religion. Therefore it is admitted that she, the Scottish Queen, has to be put to death. Shortly thereafter, a conspiracy was discovered against the person of Her Majesty, wherein her ambassador and others of her retinue were involved. Thereupon, latterly, the Queen of England has resolved to abolish the cause of such evil and of the above mentioned danger, although she agreed to the execution with but a heavy heart. She therefore dispatched several persons to carry out the sentence upon the Queen of Scotland. The officials who received this command hastened forward the execution, but this against the repeated injunction of the English Queen. Because of this, the secretary of Her Majesty, Davison, was thrown into the Tower and several others fell into disgrace.
    And the execution therefore took place in this wise:
    At the command of the Queen of England (through the secretary, Beale) the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were at the time in the neighbourhood of the castle of Fotheringhay, together with other gentlemen, knights and noble persons, with Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drury, who had order to guard the Queen of Scotland, had on the previous day, namely the 17th day of February, made known to the imprisoned Queen the will of Her Majesty of England. Thereupon she made reply that she was prepared and had long awaited this. She inquired when the execution would take place. Although this was left to her own choice, she asked that it might take place at once, on the very next day, namely on the 18th day of February of the new calendar, on a Wednesday. She besought God’s help thereto. At the same time as this notification there were laid before the Queen various apologies, namely that the kingdom of England and its Queen had been compelled to make such a decision.
    Hence on the 18th day of February, at 7 o’clock of the morning, the aforementioned earls, knights and noblemen forgathered in the castle of Fotheringhay. Two followers were allocated to each knight, but only one to the others present, so that about eighty to a hundred persons entered the castle, beside the guard and the officials of the court.
    There, in the large hall, in front of the fireplace, in which burnt a great fire, a dais had been set up, which was twelve feet wide and eight feet high. It was completely covered with black cloth, and thereon stood a chair with a cushion. As now all was ready, and the gentlemen had collected there between the hours of eight and nine, a message was sent to the imprisoned Queen that the gentlemen had come on the errand of which she had been forewarned in the afternoon of yesterday, and wished to know whether she were ready.
    The messenger, however, found the door of her chamber locked and bolted. All her people were with her in the chamber. When the gentlemen heard this, they sent a messenger once more commanding him to knock at the door, should he not find it open and to deliver the former message.
    But he found the door unlocked. He sent one of the Queen’ servants to her in order to acquaint her with his command. The servant brought answer that the Queen was not yet ready. After half an hour, the gentlemen sent to her once more, and thereto she made answer that she would be ready in half an hour.
    After this time the chief official went to the Queen. He found her on her knees with her ladies-in-waiting, praying, and told her that her time was now come. Thereupon she stood up and said that she was ready. She was led between two men of her retinue into the antechamber. There she found all her people assembled. She exhorted them all to fear God and to live in humility of spirit. She took leave of them all, kissed the women and held out her hand to the men to kiss. She begged them not to grieve on her account but to be of good cheer and to pray for her. Then she was led to the stairway. There all the gentlemen advanced from the hall towards her, and the Earl of Shrewsbury said to the sorrowing Queen: “Madame, we are here to carry out the behest of our most gracious Queen of England, which was communicated unto you yesterday." The warrant and sentence the Earl of Kent held in his hand. The Great Seal of the Crown of England was thereon. Then the Queen replied that she would as lief die as live any longer. As she turned round she perceived her most distinguished servitor, Melville, and said to him: “My faithful servant Melville, though thou art a Protestant and I ca Catholic, there is nevertheless but one Christendom and I am thy Queen, born and anointed, of the lineage of Henry VII. And so I adjure three before God that thou give this command to my son: I beg him to serve God, and the Catholic Church, and to rule and keep his country in peace and to submit (as I have done) to no other Master, although I had the right good will to unite the kingdoms of this island. I renounce this, may he do likewise, and do not let him put overmuch trust in the presumption of the world. Let him trust God and then he will be blessed by Him. Let him speak no evil of the Queen of England, and thou, Melville, art my witness that I die like a true Scotswoman, Frenchwoman and Catholic, which belief has ever been mine." These words and such like did she repeat.
    Thereupon Melville made answer: “Most venerable and most august Princess, as I have been at all times your Majesty’s faithful servant, so will I now with the help of God, faithfully and honestly transmit to the King, your Son, Your Majesty’s words and message.”
    Thereupon she turned to the above-mentioned gentlemen and desired to have her priest with her on the dais, so that he might bear witness for her to the King of France and in other places, that she had died righteously and a good Catholic. To this the gentlemen made reply that it had been ordained otherwise.
    She then demanded that her servants might remain with her. This was refused, in order to curb her impatience and to free her mind from certain superstitions. Nevertheless five of her servants and two tiring-women were permitted to come to her, because she complained that she was being poorly served. She promised that she would cause no hindrance, either by cries or by tears. Further she demanded for her servants and her maids liberty to depart, with good escort, and free of cost to their own countries without let or hindrance. This the gentlemen promised her. Also that they should be permitted to retain everything that the Queen of Scotland had presented to them. But she repeated once more: “I desire that this take place." Thereupon she was led by two servants of the Governor to the dais. There she seated herself upon a chair, for she could stand but with difficulty. The two earls seated themselves beside her. Then the Secretary Beale read the warrant and the sentence of execution in an over loud voice.
    The gown in which the Queen was attired was of exquisite black velvet, which she had likewise worn when she appeared before the gentlemen. In her hand she held a small cross of wood or of ivory with the picture of Christ thereon, and a book. On her neck hung a golden crucifix, and from her girdle a rosary.
    Near her stood a doctor of theology, Dean of Peterborough, who, at the command of the gentlemen spoke words of Christian comfort to her, exhorting her to die as a Christian with a repentant heart. She at once interrupted him and begged him to keep his peace, for she was fully prepared for death. The Dean answered that he had been commanded to speak the truth to her. But she said for the second time: “I will not listen to you, Mr. Dean. You have naught to do with me. You disturb me." Thereupon he was bidden to be silent by the gentlemen.
    The Earl of Kent said to her: “Madame, I am grieved on your account to hear of this superstition from you and to see that which is in your hand." She said it was seemly that she should hold the figure of Christ in her hand thereby to think of Him. Thereupon he answered that she must have Christ in her heart, and further said that though she made demur in paying heed to the mercies vouchsafed to her by God All-Highest, they would nevertheless plead for her with God Almighty, that He would forgive her sins and receive her into His Kingdom. Thereto the Queen made reply: “Pray, then will I also pray." then the aforesaid Doctor fell on his knees on the steps of the dais and read in an over loud voice a fervent and godly prayer for her, most suitable to such an occasion, also for the Queen of England and the welfare of the Kingdom. All those standing round repeated the prayer. But as long as it lasted the Queen was praying in Latin and fairly audibly, holding the crucifix in her hand.
    When this prayer was now ended on both sides, the executioner knelt in front of the Queen. Him she forgave his deed, as also all those who lusted after her blood, or desired her death. She further forgave all and sundry and craved from God that He might also forgive her own trespasses. Thereafter she fell on her knees in ardent supplication and besought the remission of her sins. She said that she trusted to be saved through the death of Christ and His Blood and that she was ready to have her own blood split at His feet, wherefore she held His picture and the crucifix in her hands. Further she prayed for a happy, long and prosperous reign for the Queen of England, for the prosperity of the British Isles, for the afflicted Christian Church and the end of all misery. She also prayed for her son, the King of Scots, for his upright and honourable Government and of his conversion to the Catholic Faith. At the last she prayed that all the saints in heaven might intercede for her on this day, and that God of His great goodness might avert great plagues from this Island, forgive her her sins and receive her soul into His heavenly hand. 
    Thereupon she stood up and prepared herself for death. She doffed her jewels and her gown, with the help of two women. When the executioner wished to assist her, she said to him that it was not her wont to be disrobed in the presence of such a crowd, nor with the help of such hand-maidens. She herself took off her robe and pushed it down as far as the waist. The bodice of the underskirt was cut low and tied together at the back. She hastened to undo this.
    Thereafter she kissed her ladies, commended them to God, and because one of them was weeping too loudly, she said to her: “Have I not told you that you should not weep? Be comforted." To her she gave her hand, and bade her leave the dais. When she was thus prepared, she turned to her servitors, who were kneeling not far off, blessed them and made them all witnesses that she died a Catholic and begged them to pray for her. Afterwards she fell on her knees with great courage, did not change colour, and likewise gave no sign of fear. One of her tirewomen bound a kerchief before her eyes. As she knelt down she repeated the 70th Psalm: “In te, Domine, speravi. . . ." When she had said this to the end, she, full of courage, bent down with her body and laid her head on the block, exclaiming: “In manuas tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum." Then one of the executioners held down her hands, and the other cut off her head with two strokes of the chopper. Thus ended her life.
    The executioner took the head and showed it to the people, who cried: “God spare our Queen of England!”
    When the executioner held up the head, it fell in disarray so that it could be seen that her hair was quite grey and had been closely cropped.
    Her raiment and other belongings were by command taken from the executioner, but he was promised their equivalent in money. Everything that had been sprinkled with her blood, also the garments of the executioner and other objects, were promptly taken away and washed. The planks of the dais, the black cloth and all else were thrown into the fire, at once, so that no superstitious practices could be carried on therewith.
    Her body was carried out, embalmed and made ready for burial. Where this will take place is as yet unknown. Her servants and courtiers were instructed to abide there until her remains had been honourably laid to rest. She was four-and-forty years of age, and was the most beautiful princess of her time.
    She had as first spouse, Francis II, King of France, after him Henry Stuart, the son of the Earl of Lennox, her cousin, a truly handsome young man, by whom she had issue James V, King of Scotland. But after she had caused Henry Stuart to be murdered, she took in marriage the Earl of Bothwell, who was imprisoned in Denmark, lost his senses and there died.
    After this execution had taken place, the portals of the castle remained shut, until Henry Talbot, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, had been dispatched to the English Court. When, the other day, he brought the tidings to London, the citizens of this town lit bonfires on all sides and rang the bells, because they were rid of the danger in which they had lived so long. It looks as if the populace believed that a new era had begun in which they hope that all will remain at peace.

105-106. English Attack on Cadiz

    From Madrid we have a letter of the 5th of this month, which reports from Seville on the 30th day of April, that the English pirate Drake has made an attack on Cadiz with a hundred ships, among which there were said to be five-and-twenty well-armed galleons. In this harbour they defeated the Armada, which numbered two-and twenty ships and galleons. The munitions and other objects they set on fire, because they could not take away the ships with them. The troops that were on the Spanish ships are reported for the greater part to have previously taken cover on land in face of the English Armada. These ships are said to be the artery of the whole Spanish Armada, for it is to be feared that Drake will lie in wait for them. Then there would be no fleet whatever against England on the high seas.

106-107. Christian prisoners of War in Constantinople
        Constantinople
        5 September 1587
    On the 28th day of August the poor innocent people who were captured near Ofen, arrived here, and on the 10th of this month were led into the public Divan with such triumph, jubilation and uproar that the Turks cannot remember, even in their greatest victories of old, having seen the like, or having heard of such doings from their forebears. As is testified by persons of note, who by ill-fortune have lived through many such occurrences, that never has there been such rejoicing over prisoners. This took place in the following manner: a large number of powerful and imposing Turks, decked out in sumptuous attire rode ahead. Then there were carried past by many Turks all sorts of arms, firearms, double blunderbusses, and such like which had fallen to the enemy through the aforesaid defeat. Then followed eighteen flags, among them one of His Imperial Majesty with a black eagle and the former Austrian arms. Then came the drummers, and behind them one hundred and sixty poor, misfortunate men, mostly Germans, all shackled with long chains. On each chain four or five heads were stuck on spears, often ten of them on a long pole. Of these heads there were said to be more than seventeen hundred. The aforesaid horrible procession was surrounded on all sides by distinguished frontiermen and Turks, and was led before the house of the Imperial Ambassador. There the former blew on tubes and trumpets.
    In the Divan they led the prisoners round several times as a spectacle, in order that the Sultan might behold them from a window. Then they made a pile of the heads, arranged the flags round them and made sport of them. There was such a concourse of people that the like has not been witnessed at the circumcision of the Sultan’s son or at the entry of the Persian Embassy. Then the poor men, although most of them were sorely weak and ill, were taken, according to custom, to the prisons and the galleys.
    It is said the two hundred prisoners were captured near Ofen, of which many died on the way. But the Sultan’s satisfaction with the celebrations and the rejoicing manifested over the Christian prisoners and the severed heads may be measured by the fact that he sent the Pasha of Ofen a sword set with precious stones and a robe of cloth of gold. Many are of the opinion that he will shortly make him a vizier.

107-114. Judgment on the Witch Walpurga Hausmännin
        Dilligen
        20 September 1587
            background: Confessions of Walpurga Hausmdnnin, formerly licensed midwife at Dillingen, who, for almost thirty years, practised witchcraft  and was in league with the Evil One. She was burnt at the stake at Dillingen on the 20th day of September anno domini 1587.
    The herein mentioned, malefic and miserable woman, Walpurga Hausmännin, now imprisoned and in chains, has, upon kindly questioning and also torture, following on persistent and fully justified accusations, confessed her witchcraft and admitted the following. When one-and-thirty years ago, she had become a widow, she cut corn for Hans Schlumperger, of this place, together with his former servant, Bis im Pfarrhof, by name. Him she enticed with lewd speeches and gestures and they convened that they should, on an appointed night, meet in her, Walpurga’s, dwelling, there to indulge in lustful intercourse. So when Walpurga in expectation of this, sat awaiting him at night in her chamber, meditating upon evil and fleshly thoughts, it was not the said bondsman who appeared unto her, but the Evil One in the latter’s guise and raiment and indulged in fornication with her. Thereupon he presented her with a piece of money, in the semblance of half a thaler, but no one could take it from her, for it was a bad coin and like lead. For this reason she had thrown it away. After the act of fornication she saw and felt the cloven foot of her whoremonger, and that his hand was not natural, but as if made of wood. She was greatly affrighted thereat and called upon the name of Jesus, whereupon the Devil left her and vanished.
    On the ensuing night, the Evil Spirit visited her again in the same shape and whored with her. He made her many promises to help her in her poverty and need, wherefore she surrendered herself to him body and soul. Thereafter the Evil One inflicted upon her a scratch below the left shoulder, demanding that she should sell her soul to him with the blood that had flown therefrom. To this end he gave her a quill and, whereas she could not write, the Evil One guided her hand. She believes that nothing offensive was written, for the Evil One only swept with her hand across the paper. This script the Devil took with him and whenever she piously thought of God Almighty, or wished to go to church, the Devil reminded her of it.
    Further, the above-mentioned Walpurga confesses that she oft and much rode on a pitchfork b night with her paramour, but not far, on account of her duties. At such devilish trysts she met a big man with a grey beard, who sat in a chair, like a great prince and was richly attired. That was the Great Devil to whom she had once more dedicated and promised herself body and soul. Him she worshipped and before him she knelt, and unto him she rendered other such-like honours. But she pretends not to know with what words and in which fashion she prayed. She only knows that once she heedlessly pronounced the name of Jesus. Then the above-mentioned Great Devil struck her in the face and Walpurga had to disown (which is terrible to relate) God in heaven, the Christian name and belief, the blessed Saints and the Holy Sacraments, also to renounce the heavenly hosts and the whole of Christendom. Thereupon the Great Devil baptized her afresh, naming her Höfelin, but her paramour-devil, Federlin.
    At those devilish meetings, she ate, drank and fornicated with her paramour. Because she would not allow him to drag her along everywhere he had beaten her harshly and cruelly. For food she often had a good roast or an innocent child, which was also roasted, or a sucking pig, and red and white wine, but no salt.
    Since her surrender to the Devil, she had seemingly oft received the Blessed Sacrament of the true Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, apparently by the mouth, but had not partaken of it, but (which once more is terrible to relate) had always taken it out of her mouth again and delivered it up to Federlin, her paramour. At their nightly gatherings she had oft with her other playfellows trodden under foot the Holy and Blessed Sacrament and the image of the Holy Cross. The said Walpurga states that during such-like frightful and loathsome blasphemies she at times truly did espy drops of blood upon the said Holy Sacrament, whereat she herself was greatly horrified.
    At the command and threat of her whoremonger she had oft dishonoured the consecrated font, emptied it before her house or even destroyed the same. This she was made to do only a few days before she was cast into prison, when she was in the parish church from which she took a holy water stoup and carried it home. Then her devil paramour arrayed in handsome garments encountered her in the little street between the great cloister and the stable of Martin Müller. He desired to take the holy water stoup out of her hand and forced her to hurl it against the wall. She had also been obliged sorely to dishonour the blessed Mother of God, the Holy Virgin Mary, to spit out in front of her and say: “Shame, thou ugly hussy!”  Her paramour, Federlin, came to her in many divers places in order to fornicate with hr, even in the street by night and while she lay in durance. She confesses, also, that her paramour gave her a slave in a little box with which to injure people and animals, and even the precious fruit of the field.
    He also compelled her to do away with and to kill young infants at birth, even before they had been taken to Holy Baptism. This she did, whenever possible. These as follows:
    1 and 2. About ten years ago, she had rubbed Anna Hämännin, who dwelt not far from Durstigel, with her salve on the occasion of her first childbirth and also otherwise damaged her so that mother and child remained together and died.
    3. Dorothea, the stepdaughter of Christian Wachter, bore her first child ten years before; at its birth she made press on its little brain so that it died. The Devil had specially bidden her destroy the first-born.
    4. Ten years ago she had poisoned with her slave the second child of Anna Kromt, who dwelt by the Altheim Gate, so that it died.
    5. When, four years ago, the organist’s wife was awaiting her confinement, she touched her naked body with her slave whereby the child promptly died and came stillborn.
    6. Ten years ago she destroyed and killed at birth the girl child of the wife of the present tollman.
    7. Twelve years ago she had killed at birth, with her salve and by strangulation, a girl child of the Pallingerin, who dwelt in a little house near the Danube baths.
    8. Three years ago when she was called to a mill to the miller’s wife there she had let the child fall into the water and drown.
    9. Six years ago she was called to Eislingen to a poor woman who dwelt near the church. She killed the child by pressing on it brain at the time of delivery.
    10. Eight or ten years ago she was called to Steinheim to a poor woman who lived on the other side of the river on the left bank. There also she killed the child by a special manipulation.
    11. When six years ago, she partook of food with Magdalena Seilerin, called Kammerschreiberin (wife of the chamber scribe), she had put a salve in her drink, so that she was delivered prematurely. This child she, Walpurga, secretly buried under the doorway of the said wife of the scribe on the pretext that then she would have no other miscarriage. The same she also did with many others. When she was questioned under torture for the reasons of this burial, she admitted that it was done in order to cause disunion between two spouses. This her Devil-Paramour had taught her.
    12. A child of Stoffel Schmidt she had, four years ago, put to death and after dug out of the grave.
    13. and 14. She confessed that, when, eleven years earlier, the spouse of the late Chancellor, Dr. Peuter, lay a long while in travail, she had rubbed a Devil’s salve on the placenta, whereby she became so weak that she had to be given Extreme Unction. Three hours later, mother and child remained together and died.
    15. She had also rubbed a salve on a beautiful son of the late Chancellor, Jacob by name: this child had lovely fair hair and she had given him a hobby-horse so that he might ride on it till he lost his senses. He died likewise.
    16. Eight years ago she gave the rightfully wedded wife of Otto Vischer, when she was big with child, a drink, whereafter the child was born dead.
    17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. She did slay a child of each of the following: George Gopen, Sybilla Turnerin, the wife of Jäglein, Anna Seirin, Girg Gärtner, Klingler, the coppersmith Simon Leberwurst, the groom Hans Durst.
    25. A child of the Governor here, Wilhelm Schenk von Stauffenberg, named Werner, she had so infected with her salve that he died within three days.
    26 and 27. She had smeared and killed yet two other children of the Governor with her salve.
    28 and 29. She had killed a boy child of both Master Niklas Brügelmaier and publican Kunz.
    30. Three years ago she had sucked out the blood of publican Kunz’s child, a twin, so that it died.
    She confesses likewise, that the blood which she sucked from the child, she had to spit out again before the devil, as he had need of it to concoct a salve. She could work the children no harm if they were protected by holy water. But if she herself gave the child holy water, she was able to do it damage, as she had previously passed water into it.
    31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43. She confesses that she killed a child of each of the following: Venedigerin, Hefelinin, Landstrasslerin, Fischerin, Eva auf der Bleiche, Weberin, the wife of the town scribe, Kautzin, Mechin, Weinzieherin, Berlerin and Martin Kautzin, but two of the Berlerin.
    Only a short time since she had wished to smear with a salve the small boy of Georg Klinger, but she was encountered by people and was not able to achieve this.
    She also rubbed the wife of the Governor with a salve, but as she wore a neck ornament with blessed medals on it the salve did not work.
    In the foregone winter at eventide she had rubbed the housewife of the town scribe on the arm with her salve, shortly after she suffered great pain and to this day suffers day and night in spite of all the remedies she has tried.
    When eight years ago she was helping Michel Klingler to push a cart, and Klingler wanted to lift the shafts with his head, she touched it with her salve. Since then, Klingler is fading away and death is the only thing before him.
    To the daughter of Hans Striegel, who is now in the little cloister, she gave a drink in her youth, since when she languishes and is in bad health.
    She rubbed with her salve and brought about the death of Lienhart Geilen’s three cows, of Bruchbauer’s horse, two years ago of Max Petzel’s cow, three years ago of Duri Striegel’s cow, two years ago of Hans Striegel’s cow, of the cow of the Governor’s wife, of a cow of Frau Schötterin, and two years ago of a cow of Michel Klingler, on the village green. In short, she confesses that she destroyed a large number of cattle over and above this. A year ago she found bleached linen on the common and rubbed it with her salve, so that the pigs and geese ran over it and perished shortly thereafter. Walpurga confesses further that every year since she has sold herself to the Devil, she has on St. Leonard’s Day exhumed at least one or two innocent children. With her Devil-Paramour and ether play-fellows she has eaten these and used their hair and their little bones for witchcraft.
    She was unable to exhume the other children she had slain at birth, although she attempted it, because they had been baptized before God.
    She had used the said little bones to manufacture hail; this she was wont to do once or twice a year. Once this spring, from Siechenhausen, downwards across the fields. She likewise manufactured hail last Whitsun, and when she and others were accused of having held a witches’ revel, she had actually held one near the upper gate by the garden of Peter Schmidt. At that time her playfellows began to quarrel and struck one another, because some wanted to cause it to hail over Dillingen Meadows, others below it. At last the hail was sent over the marsh towards Weissingen, doing great damage. She admits that she would have caused still more and greater evils and damage if the Almighty had not graciously prevented and turned them away.
    After all this, the Judges and Jury of the Court of this Town of Dillingen, by virtue of the Imperial and Royal Prerogative and Rights of His Right Reverence, Herr Marquard, Bishop of Augsburg, and Provost of the Cathedral, our mot gracious Prince and Lord, at last unanimously gave the verdict that the aforesaid Walpurga Hausmännin be punished and dispatched from life to death by burning at the stake as being a maleficent and well-known witch and sorceress, convicted according to the context of Common Law and the Criminal Code of the Emperor Charles V and the Holy Roman Empire. All her goods and chattels and estate left after her to go to the Treasury of our Most High Prince and Lord. The aforesaid Walpurga to be led, seated on a cart, to which she is tied, to the place of her execution, and her body first to be torn five times with red-hot irons. The first time outside the town hall in the left breast and the right arm, the second time at the lower gate in the right breast, the third time at the mill brook outside the hospital gate in the left arm, the fourth time at the place of execution in the left hand. But since for nineteen years she was a licensed and pledged midwife of the city of Dillingen, yet has acted so vilely, her right hand with which she did such knavish tricks is to be cut off at the place of execution. Neither are her ashes after the burning to remain lying on the ground, but are thereafter to be carried to the nearest flowing water and thrown thereinto. Thus a venerable jury have entrusted the executioner of this city with the actual execution and all connected therewith.

114-121. The Nun of Lisbon
     unknown
     unknown
        background: Report on the examination of the Mother Prioress of the Cloister of the Annunciation which was held on account of her wounds.
    We, Brother Luis de Granada, Brother Juan de la Curuas, confessors of His Royal Majesty and Masters of Divine Theology, and Brother de Avero, confessor in ordinary to the Mother Prioress of the Convent of the Annunciation, have, in accordance with the command of our worthy General and Brother, Sixto Fabro, betaken ourselves to the said Mother Prioress. We herein faithfully report what we purposed and learned on the 25th of November, the day of the blessed martyr, Saint Catherine. On the said day we went to the convent at 2 o’clock at night and made an unexpected demand for the Mother Prioress to appear at the grating, so that nobody should learn of it, as we were resolved in secret upon this. As we three stood before the grating, Brother Luis de Granada exhorted the Mother Prioress to patience in her grievous trouble and comforted her in her animadversion with the verse from the Psalm: Quoniam probasti nos, Deus. . . . Moreover, he spoke spiritual and kindly words unto her. Then Brother John intimated to her that it was desired that a test should be made of the truth in respect of her wounds, because with or without justice there had arisen doubts as to whether these wounds were real or only feigned. He gave her to reflect with how much less reason the Resurrection of Christ had been put in doubt by the Apostle St. Thomas and how the Master, in spite of this had deemed it right to relieve him of his misgivings.
    To this end the Master had bared His loins, laid his hand therein and also placed his fingers in the holes where had been the nails. Therefore was she also obliged patiently to endure the investigation. In order that she might not refuse, Brother John showed her a script in the hand of the Most Venerable General of the Order and in which he commanded her to do as she would be bidden by the Brothers. To all this the Mother Prioress listened with the patience of a lamb, but when she was told to bare her head and denude her loins and feet, she was deeply outraged. She locked her hands together and raised them and her eyes to heaven. Thus she manifested her horror, but eventually said she would so as she had been ordered. Thereupon she was instructed to call two or three women to the choir and to bid them stay there. Then there promptly appeared three old nuns who opened the wooden grating. The iron grating remained closed, and to this the Priors and the three women betook themselves, so that the Fathers could see everything quite clearly. The three women bared the head of the Prioress, without again cutting away her hair, for it had only been cut a few days previously by order of the Most Venerable General. There we saw quite clearly by the light of a burning taper that she had about nine or ten wounds of a blood-red colour, which were as large as glass buttons. Brother John took a clean kerchief of Dutch linen, laid it on the wounds of the head and commanded the Prioress to don her coiff again and then to return the kerchief to him. When we took leave of her and had made the tests on which we shall report later, she drew out the Dutch kerchief from under her coiff, and there was a small drop of blood thereon. We surely know that this was clean when she laid it upon her head, since Brother John had cut it with his own hand from a bale of linen, never before used. In such wise it was made manifest that the Mother Prioress had these wounds on her head and that real blood was contained therein. This we distinctly saw by the light of a burning wax candle.
    Then the Mother Prioress was ordered to denude her loins, which she did with great modesty and decency. She had shown the left side where was the wound, thus, that one could see the bare flesh and the wound as well. This is about the length of a finger, nearly straight, blood or ruby red, like the nail marks on the hands and feet; it is about the width of a finger and has in the middle a small gap, where the colour is more vivid than in the other places. In the middle, the wound is divided. When Brother John now asked the Mother Prioress whether this division was in the flesh, she declared it to be so. This was all clearly seen by candlelight. Brother John again took a kerchief of Dutch linen and laid it on the wound. The Prioress had said that she did not know whether the five drops of blood would appear this time, since this mostly occurred on Fridays and on no other days, though there had been exceptions. When we wished to take our leave, the Prioress returned the linen to Brother John. There was some blood on it, but not in the form of a cross as was wont to come to pass on Fridays.
    We then bade the Mother Prioress in the name of holy obedience to bare her feet and this she did with the help of the three old women. By the light of the candle we saw clearly and distinctly that above the instep of the right foot she had a wound—not quite round. This was of a beautiful ruby-red, and it showed in the centre the head of a nail. In the sole she had a round wound of similar colour with the black mark of a nail. This was clearly to be seen. Thereupon Brother John demanded that she show him her hand from which, for some days past, blood had issued, when she held the book in her hands, on which a young woman had taken her vows; she put forth her hand and there was to be seen a somewhat raised wound which was redder than the other. It was distinctly to be noticed that she was especially sensitive in this hand. Throughout the whole time of her test, the Prioress conducted herself obediently, patiently and humbly in bearing all that was demanded of her. She was consoled in her trial by the recitation of sacred texts and listened so diligently that twice she was wrapt in ecstasy. Firstly it was impressed upon her that the sufferings of Our Lord Jesus Christ were far greater than those of the two malefactors, for the frailty of the body of Christ, together with other causes, occasioned Him far greater pain than theirs. During this speech she was visited by a shuddering or trembling fit, which lasted a long time until Brother Luis de Granada commanded her in the name of holy obedience to compose herself, which she thereupon did. But when she was again addressed upon spiritual subjects, she fell into a trance, until she was ordered to awaken. Thereupon she was questioned by Brother Luis as to the feelings she had experienced during that time, whether her reason and will had been dead or living. To this she made reply: “Living.”
    Then she was ordered to relate what she had experienced. After some hesitation she rejoined that God had been with her and with Him a feeling of great inner peace. Brother Luis then asked her what her attitude had been when, latterly, she had had to face much tribulation and persecution on account of her miraculous doings. She responded that for her own self it was of no account but that she had only grieved for the conscience of those persons who had spoken evil of her. Brother Luis then asked what consolation the Son of God had vouchsafed to her in her trouble. Thereupon she related how He had twice bestowed on her grace and consolation. On one occasion He had appeared to her before her persecution with a large cross and had asked her whether she could carry it. “With Thy help I can,” she had replied. Thereupon God had laid the cross upon her shoulders, but it had so pressed on her and thus weakened her that for two months she had felt great pain and brokenness. The second time God appeared to her in a most beautiful and radiant form but bleeding heavily from the left side. This had given her great peace and quietude, in spite of those who spoke ill of her. “Learn how to suffer,” God had said to her on that occasion. With this we took leave of the Mother Prioress, who, with great humility, approached the grating and begged that she might be permitted to kiss the hands of Brothers Luis de Granada and Juan.
    Now this is what took place on the following Friday: on this same day the wound at the side opens and blood issues therefrom. We had asked the Mother Prioress at what hour the blood flowed on Fridays and what she felt. She made answer that it begins to flow about ten o’clock. We therefore went on the following Friday about noon, by which time the blood surely flows. We again exhorted the Prioress to have patience, for her native modesty and chastity and her retiring disposition and manner inspired her with horror at having to bare even the smallest portion of her body. As early as 10 o’clock, nay, even before we came to her, she had laid on a double piece of linen, which she took out of her bosom at our arrival and handed to us. We found the drops of blood in two places in the shape of a perfect cross. So that we might also convince ourselves with our own eyes, Brother Luis de Granada commanded her to divest herself of her scapulary in order that her hands might remain free within our sight. She also bared her side and there we beheld in the aforesaid shape the wound, open, which breaks on Fridays so that blood issues therefrom. Brother John pushed her clothing aside a little and put a fourfold cloth on the wound. We thereupon held converse with her for nearly an hour on spiritual matters, and after that time had passed, we commanded her to denude her breast before our eyes. We thereupon removed the cloth and found in its folds the five drops of blood, and other blood issuing from the wound. Thereafter in our presence she cleaned the wound with a small piece of linen, which Brother John took unto himself and retained.
    This all we have seen so clearly that we were mightily amazed and thanked God that with our eyes we should have been permitted to behold so perfect a miracle, which is such a clear witness to the holy suffering and wounds of our Redeemer. this miracle takes place under the following wondrous circumstances, which are reported herewith: Firstly, it happens on a Friday, upon which day Our Lord did suffer, and upon no other day. Secondly, the blood begins to flow about the tenth hour, when our Redeemer was crucified and received the wound. Thirdly, the five drops of blood issue from a wound, which is caused by a lance and has the shape of a cross. There are no more, and no less than five drops of blood, all of the same size, and they are situate at the same distance from each other, as if they had been measured by a compass. And these five drops have already flown for some years. They began to flow on the Holy Day of the Invention of the Cross of the year ’85 and have not ceased to issue forth on each recurring Friday, whether the Prioress be in good health, poorly or sick. It is also marvellous and clearly to be noticed that the wound, from which come these five drops, remains unchanged in this the fifth year. This may well be considered a wonder, for even if the greatest cunning be employed, it would be impossible to have this wound open and closed very Friday without there being any alteration. When one considers all that has been before mentioned, it is meet to see and recognize that this is supernatural and stands far above the possibilities and artfulness of human nature. It is therefore to be taken as a true miracle, which God alone can produce, so as to testify in favour of the divinity of the Cross and the wounds of our Saviour, as the whole faith and the Christian religion are likewise founded on this mystery. Yea, if this had but happened once or twice, it would be enough to confirm us in our belief. The miracle, however, is that it has happened so oft and through so many years. One of the noblest means, which conduce us to the Faith, are the signs and wonders of the Church, in which we believe, without having beheld them. How much more should we praise this miracle, which we have seen with our own eyes and touched with our own hands!
    We deliberated among ourselves as to the purpose Our Lord, the originator of this miracle, could have had in willing it so, that to the wounds on the hands and the feet be added these five drops of blood on the loins. It seemed to us as if this related to the five wounds of our Lord and Redeemer, and that He has thus ordered it in the days when evil reigneth, to awaken men, who sleep. Thus may they be brought to behold those who have suffered because of sin and to consider how great a curse it is. God has desired to confirm the genuineness of the wounds with these five drops of blood. Whereas there have been people deceived by the Devil, who wished to ape the wounds of Christ, our Lord has, with this miracle, confirmed His wounds, so that they can scarce be imitated. This we recorded in writing at the order of our Most Reverend Father and General, Brother Sixto Fabro de Cura, and we have signed it in Lisbon the 4th day of December 1587. Brother Luis de Granada, Brother Juan de la Curuas and Brother Caspar de Avero.
    Now there follows another test, which was undertaken by Brother Luis de Granada and Brother Caspar de Avero, Preacher General, on the 10th day of November 1587, on St. Martin’s eve, in order that the colour of the wounds of the Mother Prioress of the Convent of the Annunciation be tested.
    We, Brother Luis de Granada and Brother Caspar de Avero, are well aware of the guile of certain persons, who have brought forward false witness and maintained that the wounds of the Mother Prioress have been painted with ochre or other colours. We confess that, driven by our zeal and longing to end this public vexation, we have betaken ourselves to the convent, at the order of our Superiors, there to probe the truth of these assertions. We bade the Mother Prioress appear at the window of the Community in the presence of other nuns and have comforted her on account of the false allegations and pointed out to her the example of our Redeemer and other Saints, who also found comfort, and in particular the Holy Catherine of Sienna, who was represented as a woman of false and deceitful holiness. We exhorted her to show patience and told her, that if what we were about to undertake was likely to cause her pain, it was happening to the glory of God and was necessary for the repression of the doings of the evil-minded and the faithless. She passed through all these storms with great patience and humility, nor did she manifest resentment, indignation, or utter any complaint against those who spoke so vilely anent her. She likewise noticed how afflicted and disquieted her nuns showed themselves. As she stretched forth her hands through the said window, she said: “Nunc cognovi quoniam voluisti me, quoniam non gaudebit inimicus meus super me." After these words were spoken, Brother Luis de Granada wetted a kerchief in a vessel filled with water and began to wash the wound therewith and to rub it, which could not come to pass without great pain, for she suffered whenever he came close to the nail. Whilst she was being rubbed very hard on all sides of the wound, and on one spot in particular, and when her dolour became too pressing she sighed, “O Wounds of my Lord Jesus Christ!”  Thereupon we stopped for a while in order that she might rest. But soon after we began again and did this surely three or four times in the hour which we passed with her. The other nuns, who were present, felt great pity with her; they consoled her and exhorted her to be patient, for the sake of the Love, in the name of which all this was happening. As ultimately there was no change either in the water in which the cloth had been wetted or in the colour of the wounds, we gave up tormenting her any further. She suffered so greatly thereby, that for two days she was unable to eat with her hands. This the sisters who tended her can affirm, as will also many other nuns. This is the testimony which we fell compelled to render truthfully according to the order received by us, and we sign this with our names the 10th day of November 1587 in Lisbon.

121-122. The Great Armada is Made Ready to put to Sea
        Madrid
        18 May 1588
    The last courier from Lisbon brings news of there having arrived a letter from London. Therefrom one learns of the preparations which are being made here. The people are reported to be unwilling to embark, and it is presumed that the Catholics will join forces when the Armada arrives. It is also suspected that various lords will be their leaders.
    There were many women on board the Armada. The Duke ordered the captains to make a list of how many of them each had in his ship, and he requested them to bring the list to him in three or four days. It was found that there were somewhat more than six hundred. They were then not only put ashore again, but also removed from Lisbon. This was done after the soldiery had already come on board the ships. They were far from pleased on this account, but were comforted with the report that there were comely wenches in England.

122-123. Excommunication of the Queen of England
        Salzburg
        14 July 1588
    There is war against England in the air, and nothing will come of attempts for peace, for His Holiness the Pope has had a Bull read publicly in the Chapel of the Vatican in the presence of my most gracious Lord of Salzburg. Therein the Queen of England is declared to be dispossessed of her kingdom, her lands and her subjects, being long since a condemned heretic. Her subjects, of whatever rank they be, are released from the vow whereby heretofore they had sworn her allegiance.
    The Pope also deprives her of all the titles she had held up to now, divests her of all honours and transfers them all to the King of Spain. On this account the latter is now to declare himself to be rightfully chosen and appointed King of England and Ireland, and Protector of the Catholic Faith in that country. He is to wage war upon the Queen and to endeavour to bring her lands and her people under his sway. His Holiness has publicly proclaimed His Majesty King of Spain, England and Ireland, and will bestow this title upon him for all time, on condition, however, that His Majesty when he obtain possession of these provinces pay tribute to the Holy Roman See with a certain yearly pension as is done on behalf of the Kingdom of Naples.
    In order that His Majesty should be able to do this with the greater ease, His Holiness is granting him a million crowns for his assistance: half of it for the present putting to sea of the Armada, and the other half whenever His Majesty’s forces have set foot in England and captured an important harbour.

123. Mutiny of the Janissaries
        Venice
        22 July 1588
    The latest letters from Constantinople report that the Janissaries there manifested great rebellion on account of a complaint against their Aga. In order that such rebellion should not turn into something worse, the Grand Signior had the said Aga imprisoned in a very deep dungeon and four of his councillors of the highest rank impaled, whereupon he gave the Janissaries a new Aga.

123-124. A Circus Rider at the Imperial Court
        Prague
        31 August 1588
    A few days ago an Italian showed especial skill before His Imperial Majesty and the Archdukes. First, he shot with a Persian arrow behind and in front of him in full gallop, thereupon he stood in such wise that he put one foot to the ground and then again bestrode his horse. Thirdly, he stood on his saddle in full gallop. Fourthly, he unsheathed and again sheathed a sword in full gallop. Fifthly, when his horse was running fast, he stood with his head upon the saddle and had his feet up in the air. Sixthly, he turned back in his saddle and to the front again in full gallop. Seventhly, he trotted his horse in a circle, stood upright in his saddle and placed a long pole upon his head. This pole he guided with his head and shoulders and brandished like a fencer with his two hands. The horse which he had worked so hard, did not sweat and was to all appearances a Turkish horse. This skill pleased His Majesty and the Archdukes full well, and the rider received a large gift as a reward.

124-126. Persecution of the Protestants in Salzburg
unknown
        3 September 1588
            background: Copy of the Princely Mandate of Salzburg concerning the exercise of the Religion.
    We, Wolf Dietrich, Archbishop of Salzburg by the Grace of God, Legate of the Holy Roman See, hereby declare and make known: In our Capital of Salzburg, we have found several of our citizens and inhabitants opposed to our old and true Catholic Faith, who after loyal and fatherly exhortation, information and instruction, in spite of the several weeks’ respite granted, have stubbornly persisted in their pre-conceived and antagonistic opinions. On this account we bid them to leave the town and the Archbishopric, for the sake of preventing further trouble and embarrassment. So that they may know how it stands with their real and movable property and their merchandise, we have public announced the following articles:
    Firstly: It is our earnest will that those who leave our town of Salzburg make a statement of all their real estate and property before their departure and omit nothing nor leave it unregistered. This also applies to those who have already left. This statement is to be handed to us in writing. Should any one show disobedience herein or hide anything, his property is to become forfeit to us as fiscal property and subject to our domain. So that those who are no longer here should not remain in ignorance, they are to be advised of this by our Civic Authorities, through their tenants, or their own messengers, otherwise we shall proceed against the recalcitrant with heavy fines.
    Secondly: They are to sell their houses and property, in and around our town, within one month, to such persons as shall find favour in our eyes, or, after this time has lapsed, make them over to them for a reasonable sum until the latter can dispose of them. Since we shall not permit that the houses be closed or that we see bad servants and citizens within them, we shall let such houses and gardens through our Civic Authorities to others for a low rent. For as Prince and Ruler of these lands we are not willing to have our capital stand partly empty, but wish that it should be fully inhabited.
    Thirdly: Those who leave this town for the sake of their faith are not to hold any civic rights or honours in our Archbishopric. They are to be treated here as foreigners and strangers. But if any one of them should again return to the Catholic Faith, and tender the customary allegiance, we will reinstate him fully in all things. In the meantime, however, they are to be allowed to take their goods and chattels through our Archbishopric, unhampered, as do other strangers and foreigners.
    Fourthly: They are not venture to trade in the outer town of Salzburg or any other town in our Archbishopric. But should they resort to smuggling or carry on their calling with their own servants or other citizens and inhabitants of this town in any other name, their wares are to be considered our fiscal property.
    Fifthly: They are to be permitted, as need arises, to travel through our Archbishopric. But the must not cause any offence and must frequent only the open inns. Neither are they allowed to sojourn longer than three days without our Councillor’s knowledge, especially within our town of Salzburg.
    Sixthly: Whatever they have need to transact in our Archbishopric, this may they do, but only through Catholic proxies, and not through sectarian servants.
    Seventhly: Those who hold guardianships and have foster-children are to make over their trust-moneys and render proper account of them. In their place are to be appointed Catholic guardians who will bring up the wards in the Catholic Faith.
    Eighthly: Wards, who are not here, but live in sectarian places are to be cited and brought hither by our Town Council. They are to be sent to strange places only with our foreknowledge.
    Ninthly: All those who have already put their property in order or do not hold any and are ready to depart, are to leave our town of Salzburg and our Archbishopric within fourteen days of this date and see to it that they are not encountered here any more.
    All this is our Will, Wish and Command.
    In true Testimony of this our Mandate we have signed and written it by our own hand.
    Issued in our town of Salzburg on the 3rd day of September in the year 1588 after Christ our Lord and Redeemer’s birth.
                    WOLF DIETRICH m.p.

126. Toleration of Jews in Rome
       Rome
       24 September 1588
    Different Jews from the Levant and other places have appeared here. They are said to have offered much money to the Papal Chamber. It is probable that they may receive privileges in order that they may trade with their merchandise in the Roman State.

126-127. Return of the Circumnavigator Cavendish
        Mittelburg
        6 October 1588
    Mestre Candis, a nobleman, who on his own venture, had set sail twenty-five months before with two ships and one pinnace, has arrived in England. He sailed round the world along the route of Magellan and robbed, burnt and sank nineteen ships in the Pacific. On land he burnt ten towns and inflicted great damage upon the Spaniards. Among other things he conquered a big galleon which was on her way from China to the Indies or Peru. She was richly laden with silks and other wares. According to the inventory found, her cargo was worth 350,000 ducats. He took what was best, loaded it into his ships, and burnt the rest with the galleon. He returned home by way of the Cape of Good Hope, richer by almost one million. The two hundred men he had with him have all grown wealthy. The English Earl of Cumberland is also said to have the intention of setting out upon such an expedition.

127. Contraband of War
        Antwerp
        12 November 1588
    The Queen of England has requested the Eastern Ports to allow no pitch, resin, masts and other shipbuilding material to go to Spain and Portugal. In case of non-compliance she has decided to confiscate these goods, should they fall into English hands.

127. The End of the “Great Armada”
       Hamburg 
       November 1588
            background: Report from England about the Spanish Armada, received in Augsburg from Hamburg.
    The Armada of the King of Spain set sail from Portugal with one hundred and thirty-five ships to wit: four galleasses from Naples, four galleons from Portugal, ten vessels with victuals, fourteen Venetian ships, among them several galleons. The remainder was made up of other large and small craft. The Armada arrived in Corunna on the 5th day of July, from whence it intended to sail for Flanders,, there to join forces with the Duke of Parma and invade England. At that time the English Armada was in Plymouth Port.
    After they had been under sail from Corunna eight days they arrived in Ostend and thereupon lay south of the shores of England, where for four or five days they had various skirmished with the English Armada. On that occasion the English took two ships. On one of these there was Don Pedro di Mendoza, whom they took prisoner and so to England. Storms south of England caused them the loss of four Portuguese galleons which remained stranded on the French coast. They then proceeded and cast anchor off Calais, since they could no longer get as far as Dunkirk. They wished to wait for the Duke of Parma in Calais, but he sent word that he could not be ready under eight days. Thereupon the admiral sent reply that he would again set sail for Spain. Meanwhile the English sent forth against the Spanish Armada several burning ships, so that they were forced to cut their moorings and to retire hastily. Each ship left two anchors behind and four of the largest galleasses were stranded and wrecked off Calais. The following day at eight o’clock, the two Armadas had a further encounter, heavily bombarding each other for eight hours. In this battle the Spanish lost four ships, namely two Portuguese galleasses, a vessel from Biscay and one other. All four went to the bottom of the sea. Three large Venetian craft remained behind off the coast of Flanders and were in great peril of going under. The inhabitants of Flushing took two of these ships, and the third was shipwrecked. One of them had on board the Colonel commanding the garrison of Seville. According to the prisoners’ report the Spaniards lost four thousand men in the battle off Calais, amongst them the Commander-in-Chief of the cavalry at Naples and Seville. The Spaniards are said to have left one hundred and twenty ships, although others could count only one hundred and ten. The big galleon, which the Duke of Florence had sent, was not to be seen anywhere after the battle.
    Hereafter the Armada made off and was pursued by the English for five days as far as Scotland. When they counted their men there they found that they had already lost eight thousand, most of whom had been killed or died of disease. From thence they set sail for Ireland without taking provisions on board. Off Ireland they lost two ships, the San Sebastian and the San Mathias, which had four hundred and fifty-six men on board. Lacking fresh water, the fleet threw many horses and mules overboard off Ireland. When they sailed away from Ireland, the Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, ordered each one of his captains to set his course for Corunna or the first Spanish port. They thus sailed together throughout ten days. Then the storm separated the Duke of Medina Sidonia with twenty-seven of his ships from them and no one knew where they had gone. The last time the Armada was assembled it counted no more than seventy-eight ships. Of the big galleasses not one was left. Two of the Duke of Medina Sidonia’s ships ran ashore. Only two or three of the men were saved. They say that the Chief Admiral had left on board only five-and-twenty more barrels of wine, but little bread and no water. His masts had been so weakened by firing that he could not carry full canvas. The Duke had three English pilots on board ship. On the 10th day of September a further large ship of five hundred tons, Maria della Rosa, ran ashore off Ireland. On it were the Colonel Michael Oquendo, commander of part of this fleet, and also the Prince of Ascoli, the bastard son of the King of Spain, twenty-eight years of age. There were besides these ten noblemen, seven captains and five hundred soldiers. They all perished excepting one pilot who saved himself on a plank. He says that the King’s bastard son came on board this ship off Calais. The vessel carried fifty cannon and twenty-five other metal pieces, as well as 15,000 ducats and silver reals and much gold. The same day two big vessels put eight hundred and fifty men ashore in Ireland, seven hundred of whom died, and the remainder were taken prisoner. The vessels were cast ashore. On the 12th day of September another big ship was wrecked. Thirteen noblemen were taken prisoner and four hundred men reached land. From yet another ship seventy-eight bodies were washed ashore. From a further wrecked vessel three noblemen, a bishop and seventy-nine mercenaries were taken prisoner. The others perished. On the 17th day of September two large vessels, the St. Joaquim and the St. Martin, sank. The admiral was de Ricaldo, and his ship was almost the largest in the whole fleet. There were on it eight hundred soldiers, sixty Portuguese and forty Biscay fishermen. They had starved for almost four days.
    Finally another galleon of four hundred and fifty tons was wrecked with an Italian margrave and the old Naples and Seville garrison. On it were also Don Alonzo de Layba, Mestre de Campo of the cavalry in Milan. On the 18th day of September there arrived news from Ireland that very many bodies had been washed ashore.

127-130. Mourning Prohibited in Spain
        Middelburg
        14 November 1588
    It is said that news has arrived from Ireland that a further nine ships of the Spanish Armada have perished there. Sixteen hundred men are reported to be still alive, to whom the Irish are lending help. For that reason the Queen of England has dispatched thither six hundred men who are to take up hostilities against these people. From Sicily there comes information that the General Duke of Medina in Seville organized there a great procession to celebrate his return. Ninety ships of the Armada are missing, and every one has been forbidden to mourn his friends who were lost with the Armada. A forty days’ fast has been ordered, hoping that thereby the return home of the missing ships will be obtained.

130. Letter from the East Indies
        East Indies
        December 1588
            background: Letter from Oriental India, received in Augsburg on the 15 December 1588.
    During the month that has passed the Portuguese dispatched an Armada to the coast of Melindo because the Turks wrought much damage there a year ago. They were also expected this year, but they did not arrive. Since several fortresses there showed favour to the Turk, the Armada burnt three of them down to the ground and killed every one over five years old. One king they decapitated and sent his head here. Other fortresses asked for mercy and made their peace with the captain. When peace had been restored the Armada returned here again. A further Armada was also sent to Malacca in April. There the King of Gior laid siege to the town which had been in great peril. In a month’s time the ships are to return again. Great importance is attached to this town on account of navigation to China, Japan and the Moluccas, for the ships have to put into harbour there. Owing to the fact that the Moluccas are in revolt, two galleons returned from there last year with but a small supply of cloves. A great number of troops are sent to this place, but as the Moors poison them they are mostly buried there. Ceylon has been besieged by land and water for eight months by King Rag. Assistance was dispatched thither in September, but so far not much has been achieved. It is in great danger and daily expects a fleet which is to be sent to them from Goa. May God grant them success, for this country is in great need of this fort because it is the richest island on this coast and all the ships coming from China, Malacca, the Moluccas and Bengal have to put into harbour there. It is rumoured that in the Straits of Moqua there are twelve or more galleys belonging to the Turks, but it is not yet known what it is they want, nor whither they are bound. It is supposed, however, that they are making for the coast of Melinda, to which an Armada is to be sent in January. Along the coast from Dug as far as Cap Camerin there are many other pirates who cause great depredations, take many ships and kill many Portuguese. But it is not possible to put a stop to their doings because of the many other affairs on hand which require attention.

130-131. A Quack
        Strasburg
        22 December 1588
    Here there is one, Czspar Hartenfels by name, who calls himself Theophrastista. He is accused by our doctors of being a murderer. They produced many witnesses against him. I believe his sojourn here will not be of much longer duration. The town of Nuremberg has also shown him to the gates and sent him about his business. His wife is said to be of good repute and of good service to women in childbed.

131. Peter’s Pence

        16 December 1588
    During the last days the Pope has again deposited in the Castello a further sixty thousand gold crowns, so that now there are in all four millions in actual coin.

132. The Murder of the Guises
unknown
        December 1588
            background: How the terrible butchery happened on the 23rd and the 24th days of December 1588.
    On the 15th day of September last King Henri, the third of that name, convened Parliament in France that all the clerical and secular states might meet and take counsel with one another as to the attainment of peace and unity in matters of religion as well as in politics. But the States did not assemble until a good while later, and the Huguenots and the adherents of Navarre found means and ways to prevent this plan of the Catholics. It was their wish that the Pope’s Bull of Excommunication should be put into force from Rome so that he and his successors might never obtain possession of the crown of France. But at this time many events are taking place at Blois. Each faction desires to draw the King over to its side. And the King, finding himself hard pressed by both parties, sanctioned the following terrible murder in order to regain his lost prestige.
    On the 23rd day of September the King invited the Duke of Guise to Blois to discuss and settle with him matters of paramount importance. The latter goes to the King on that very day at eight o’clock in the morning. But as he enters the hall leading to the King’s chamber, there springs upon him from behind the door one who has been hired for this purpose, and inflicts upon him two or three wounds in the back with a dagger. Thereupon several of the King’s halberdiers hasten to the scene to do him to death. This all in the presence of the King. Thereafter the King gave orders for the assassination of the Cardinal de Guise, the brother of the murdered Duke, and for the arrest of other noblemen, and amongst them the provost of the Paris merchants.

132. A Miracle in Weimar
        Weimar
        20 January 1589
    In this town there lives a burgess of the name of Nicolaus Walhelm, a glover. He has a stag’s antler with six points, which had parted company with the stag’s head twenty years before and has lain for almost all of that time in the loft amidst other antlers. This had been given to him as a present and at midday on the 18th day of September of the past year of 1588, he bored a hole through it with a clinching-iron and nailed it up in his room. The same night at eight o’clock the antler on the wall starts to bleed of its own accord from the largest horn. So it continues all night, also the following Thursday throughout the day and the night until Friday at 6 o’clock in the morning. The drops of blood fall on to a wooden seat below, and neither water nor soda can remove the stains from it, for the blood has eaten into it very deeply. In the end, the whole horn bled, and that to such an extent, as could never have happened with an ordinary antler. This has been witnessed with their own eyes by our pastors, as well as by many of the nobility and the citizens, all in all more than four hundred persons. The Government have had the antler removed and the old Duchess commanded the antler to be brought to her, and there it still is. God knows what this portends.

133. Veracious Account of Divers Places of Repute and Importance in Constantinople
unknown
        1589
    There are 4492 large streets in Constantinople, in each of which there are special churches which are called mosques in Turkish. There are 2185 streets without churches. There are likewise 442 churches in the town in which the Christians are allowed to hold their services. There are besides this 100 hospitals, 895 baths, called Hamman in Turkish. Then there are 941 fountains or water troughs, the water of which it is a delight to drink. Not counting the bakeries there are 275 common baking stoves, and then there are 585 corn mills. Fifteen houses cater for the mules of strangers and pilgrims. Then there are also 418 inns for the care of strangers. They have also 115 special big schools where excellent knowledge may be gained in art and languages. Then there are 165 ordinary children’s schools. The town has 24 gates, and the city wall boasts of a height of 360 feet and large turrets. In circumference the city measures eighteen foreign miles, or nearly three German miles.

133-134. English Raid on Corunna
unknown
        6 May 1589
        background: Copy of a letter by an English Captain to the English Secretary in London anent Drake’s raid on Corunna.
    Through God’s help we arrived in Corunna on the 7th day of April, and the same day we set ashore, about two miles from the town, a number of our soldiery whom we divided into several detachments. They arrived in good battle formation about the distance of a musket shot from the fortress. On the following day at midnight we passed about one hundred pinnaces and barges with soldiery and cannon, between the ships and the fortress, disembarked the soldiery and fired with two big cannon upon the enemy. Soon thereupon the assault was made amid vociferous shouting and terrible firing, so that the enemy forsook their barricades and fled into the mountains. We then kept the enemy busily engaged with much continuous firing and shot down a large portion of the city wall with big cannon. In the harbour we found two galleons, one of them a marvellously big vessel with fifty-two big pieces. We set fire to the vessel, but removed the cannon. We further took a large ship from Biscay of about five hundred tons which was well equipped with copper and iron pieces, also a hulk of three hundred tons, likewise well equipped with pieces, and many more ships besides. Altogether we took from the enemy 140 big cannon. In the town we found in abundance wheat, flour, salted meat, fish, wine, oil, biscuits, powder, lead, anchors, sails, hemp and such-like. All these stores had been deposited here for the provisioning of the Royal Armada which was to have sailed from here on the last day of this month. After that our people devastated the country-side for seven to eight miles around the town. Now and then they came upon a band of Spanish soldiers, in all over two thousand, who, however, took to flight. We hope to God that with His help we shall achieve the same success in other places, so that the Spaniards’ arrogance towards the little island of England may be brought low. The provision and ammunition were of great assistance to us.
    After having learnt during the last days that our enemies, about 8500 strong, had fortified themselves by a bridge some four miles from here, our general went to encounter them in good battle formation. After much skirmishing, he put the enemy to flight, killed four or five hundred of his men and pursued them for half a mile. They left behind them more than three thousand suits of armour and all manner of arms. Our people thus gained possession of a great number of horses and mules, and badly devastated the country-side by fire for eight miles round.

134-135. The Murder of Henry III
unknown
unknown
            background: Report of the murder of the King of France.
    On the first day of the month of August, a young Dominican friar betook himself to St. Cloud where the late King sojourned, with a passport from the Count de Brienne, who is kept imprisoned in Paris. On his arrival he informed the guard that he had something which he wished to communicate to the King. The King ordered that he might be permitted to deliver his message on the following day. The Provost-Marshal gave the monk quarters at the King’s request and entertained him right nobly. The monk said he was minded to do the King a great service. The following day the Provost-Marshal led the monk to the King’s chamber. But, as there were several persons present, the monk demanded that the King might receive him alone. He led him into his cabinet and read various scripts which the monk handed to him. When the King had perused the last, he asked the monk whether he had any more. The latter thereupon replied “Yes,” and, in place of the script, drew forth from his sleeve a short knife, the width of two fingers, which he thrust into the King’s abdomen below the navel. He left it sticking in the wound. The King pulled it out himself and thus enlarged the wound. He then himself inflicted a stab upon the monk. At his calls for help several people came into the room, among them La Bastida, who helped to murder the late Guise, and he with his dagger slashed at the monk. Also one of the halberdiers thrust has halberd into the monk so that he was mortally wounded. He said that he had not hoped to come off so easily. After his death his corpse was dragged along the streets, sent asunder by four horses, and publicly burnt. The King did not expect to die of his wound. He walked up and down his room, and showed himself to his servants and to the soldiery at the window. But at four o’clock in the evening he felt great pains and when the doctors visited him they found the injury to be most grievous. They gave him an enema, and discovered that the intestine had been injured. The wound turned black and the King was informed of his perilous condition. He did not at first believe this, because he was feeling fairly well. But by and by he became weaker and a Capuchin was sent for to comfort him. But when he arrived the King no longer spoke. He died upon the 2nd day of this month at midnight. The body has not been interred as yet, and has been taken to Senlis. It is said that he has asked the King of Navarre not to take revenge for his death on the city of Paris. The story goes that the monk had delivered discourses not far from Paris and had then said that he would take the King’s life. Even though he be burnt and quartered, he would feel no pain. The King of Navarre is still in St. Cloud and is besieging Paris to the extent of his power. He has made himself King of France and is thus acclaimed by his followers. He tries all ways and means in order to win to his side both the nobility and the common people. The Council of Paris has declared the Cardinal of Bourbon, who is held a prisoners in the castle of Chion, to be king. The King of Navarre intends to go to Rheims to be crowned there and to gain possession of the three royal cities.

135-137. Another Burning of Witches
        Schwab-Munchen
        5 September 1589
    There again follows a confession given at Court by a monster who was burnt here yesterday. Her accomplice, who was also taken prisoner with her and who is said to be a very rich peasant woman from Bobingen, died last Saturday in prison. It is reported that she has taken neither food nor drink for four days, nor given any evidence, for her devilish paramour has forbidden her to do so. She also continually called upon him to come and fetch her. She would listen to no mention of God or other holy matters. The witch, who was condemned yesterday, made a noose out of the straw on which she was lying and tied it round her neck in order to hang herself, but when food was brought in to her this was discovered and prevented.
    Rumour hath it that the late sorceress was to have been burnt with the other witch, but neither I nor others did see anything of her. She must have been led away in secret and have lain hidden under the stake, and so both must have been burnt together. These monsters are said to have denounced many others who will in their turn meet their fate. Some one tells me that they brought another four such persons from Bobingen before dawn to imprison them. It is also rumoured that they will not spare the beautiful ones, once they have done away with the ugly and the lewd ones. One of the four brought in is reported to be a wealthy widow. The Bishop has made up his mind to exterminate all this vermin from his diocese. Dillingen also shows signs of this plague. The Bishop will probably have his hands full for some time to come with burnings and in the end, perhaps, even put part of the nobility in golden chains.
    The present misfortunate female, Anna Schelkl, widow of Hans Schelkl of Bobingen, who has been produced in public, has permitted herself to be shamefully imposed upon and seduced by the accursed Satan, in contravention of the commands of God. She has repeatedly yielded herself to him in fornication and thus committed adultery in a strictly forbidden and sodomitic manner, and for over thirty years she has delivered herself to accursed witchery. She has denied God and all His Heavenly Hosts as well as Holy Baptism, and instead of the sign of the Lord she has allowed her body to be marked with the four signs of the Devil. She has thus beyond doubt permitted herself to be led astray from the divine mercy of God and to surrender herself to the sway of the Evil One. By means of the said witchcraft she has caused great harm and destruction and death to little children, people, horses and other animals and also assisted in spoiling and ruining the precious corn of the fields. Therefore the judges of this hamlet, Schwab-München, are unanimously agreed upon their verdict that Anna Schelkl be handed over to the executioner and be led by him to the common place of execution, there to be dispatched from life to death by burning on account of her loathsome and highly punishable misdeeds. Her goods and chattels to go to the Treasury of His Honour, the Venerable Herr Marquard, Bishop of Augsburg and Provost of the Cathedral of Bamberg. Let every one beware of such horrible sin!
    Warning to those named hereunder: I hereby give notice to all official persons, servitors, citizens, subjects and tenants, of whatever rank they be, who owe allegiance to my Gracious Prince and Master, and especially to those of this hamlet, on their oath and loyalty, to put this sentence into execution. Whosoever makes so bold as to hinder it by force is to be proceeded against and to be treated in like manner. Let all beware that they do not come to grief!

    From France confirmation is received of the fact that the King of Navarre has adopted the large coat of arms of France. He causes himself to be publicly acclaimed and styled King of France. The body of the young murdered King Henry he had buried in Senlis.
    In all parish churches of Paris obsequies have been celebrated for Jacques Clément, who murdered the King. It is thought that the Paris people wish to erect a statue in eternal memory of him as the liberator of his country.

140-142. The Famous Alchemist Bragadini
        Venice
        November 1589
    Your Grace will no doubt have learnt from the weekly reports of one Marco Antonio Bragadini, called Mamugnano. He is the bastard son of a nobleman here and was born in Cyprus. He is reported to be able to turn base metal into gold. Our government has had him conveyed hither under safe escort because the Inquisition has put him under ban. He is forty years old and was formerly possessed of no mean fortune, but spent it in riotous living. Then for a time he was mint-master to the Grand Duke Francis. From thence he came to the late Pope Gregory, who held him in great esteem. He thus obtained several thousand ducats. But when these too had been spent, he became a Capuchin and had taken his second vows. But since he could not subject himself to the strict rule of the order, he absconded without dispensation (hence the excommunication ban by the Holy Office) and betook himself to France. There he served several princes incognito. Latterly he has returned again to Bergamo in Italy and has exhibited his art in Valcamonica and in a short time increased his fortune to over and above two hundred thousand crowns. He has expounded his craft to several persons and it had got so far that he was prevailed upon to come here of his free will. Such a host of princes and lords beleaguered him that he was scarcely safe, although he had a bodyguard of fifty archers. This man is now here in this city, holds banquet daily for five hundred people and lives in princely style in the Palazzo Dandolo on the Giudecca. He literally throws gold about in shovelfuls. This is his recipe: he takes ten ounces of quicksilver, puts it into the fire and mixes it with a drop of liquid, which he carries in an ampulla. Thus it promptly turns into good gold. He has no other wish but to be of good use to his country, the Republic. The day before yesterday he presented to the Secret Council of Ten two ampullas with this liquid, which have been tested in his absence. The first test was found to be successful and it is said to have resulted in six million ducats. I doubt not but that this will appear mighty strange to Your Grace. It verily sounds like a fairy tale, but Your Grace will surely believe us, for everything is so obvious that it cannot be doubted. The confectioning of this liquid is, however, his secret, for in his letter of safe conduct he made express demand that he be not forced to divulge this. He also craves nothing more from this our Government but that it may exercise good watch over his life and his person. In return he will provide them with gold in sufficiency according to their demands. He has already made known that he is greatly amazed at the ignorance of the world, in not discovering this art before, considering that little is requisite for this achievement. This is truly marvellous and quite novel to all of us. The alchemists have taken heart of grace again and are working night and day. One hears of nothing but of this excellent man who, as already stated, has no other wish but to serve his country.
        Venice, the 8 December 1589
    You have learnt latterly that the craft of the alchemist Marco Bragadini after being tested has been approved of. The tests have shown this sufficiently. The most noble personages here address him by the title “Illustrissimo” and feast with him daily. The Duke speaks to him in the second person. By day noblemen attend upon him, by night he is guarded by armed barges. Whereas so many strange people have arrived here, the Government holds in readiness three fully equipped galleys.
        Venice, 16 December 1589
    The alchemist is said to be at work now in making five thousand sequins per month at the request of our rulers. Thereafter he will make fifteen or sixteen millions more which he has promised to hand over to it. Day by day he shows himself to great pomp. He makes his friends presents of twenty thousand and more ducats at a time. Monday last he gave a banquet in honour of the Duc de Luxembourg, the French Catholic Ambassador in Rome, which, without counting all kinds of special confectionery, cost near upon six hundred crowns.
        Rome, 16 December 1589
    The Venetian Ambassador has solemnly besought the Pope that Mamugnano, the alchemist, who now resides in Venice, may remain there without molestation by the Holy Office, on account of his being a former Capuchin. Thereupon the Pope made answer that he was not a little surprised at the afore-mentioned Rulers putting so much faith in that man. Though his art might be found to be successful, yet it only could accrue unto him by the help of Satan.
        Venice, 4 January 1590
    It is said of our Mamugnano that his craft for transforming quicksilver into gold does suffice for small quantities, but fails to produce larger ones. It is reported that the night before last he made two ingots in the presence of one pound. There no longer exists any doubt in the matter. Discussion, however, is rife amongst some of this city’s philosophers as to whether Mamugnano can renew the material wherewith he has made his gold, once it is used up. Some say yes, and others say no, so that it is doubtful what they really think about it.

142-143. Gold from New Spain
        Venice
        12 January 1590
    News reaches us from Lyons that letters from Lisbon of the 18th day of December of the past year report the arrival in Seville from New Spain of the fleet with eight millions in gold. More ships are expected to arrive shortly, which had to remain behind on account of storms. They are bringing a further four millions. This cause for the delay in the arrival of the first ships is the fact that they took their course several degrees higher than is their wont in order to escape the English cruisers who were waiting for them on the usual degree. The other ships have probably taken their course along other degrees for the same reason.

    Mamugnano changed a pound of quicksilver into gold some days ago. But he is not satisfied with this weight, because he has been asked by several persons to produce a larger sum.

143-145. Letter from East India
        East India
        January 1590
            background: Tidings received in letters from Oriental India
    When the last ships set sail in the year 1589, the following exploits of war took place. The Armada, which Manuel Continho and his brother Thomas de Sansa had dispatched to the coast of Melindo on the 19th day of January 1589, numbered five galleys and fifteen other ships. They carried twelve hundred Portuguese. When, after heavy storms, there arrived within sight the Estrecho de Moqua, they noticed that four Turkish galleys had landed on the coast of Melindo near a place called Mombassa. On this island the Turks had built a fortress for their protection, not suspecting the coming of the Portuguese. The latter went ashore, and near on three hundred thousand natives banded themselves together in order to proceed to the island at low tide and to eat the people living there, which they had also done now and again on the mainland. For this reason the Turks had removed the cannon from the galleys for their protection, not apprehending any danger from the open sea. But the Portuguese Armada intervened, captured the Turkish galleys without resistance, and thereupon landed. When the Turks saw this they sought to take refuge on the mainland, but they were cruelly handled and eaten by the wild natives. Some of the Turks surrendered to the Portuguese, preferring captivity to being devoured by the cannibals. Thus the Portuguese took prisoner several Turks and Arab Moors.
    The Portuguese general ordered the King of Mombassa, who owes allegiance to the King of Portugal, to be decapitated, because he had granted the Turks asylum in his territory. The fortress erected by the Turks was razed to the ground and the island pillaged. Then the Portuguese left the field clear to the Simbas, who killed and ate the people before the eyes of the Armada, so that within five days not a living creature was there left on the island. When they had cleared everything and had nothing more to eat, they again went to the mainland. They thereupon set out northward for the land of John, the Priest. Those of the Armada relate that the Simbas are well equipped with sharp arrows and eat all the men they can lay their hands on, and their wives they lead away with them alive. But they do not suffer a sick person among them. As soon as one falls sick, they kill and eat him. The Portuguese report that the natives were six hundred thousand strong when they set out upon their quest. Once they reach a place they do not leave it as long as they can find a man to eat, after which they depart. Victory fell to our Armada because the Simbas had caused so much trouble to the Turks that it was an easy matter to capture the galleys, which were taken into Goa on the 16th day of March.
    Letters were sent with the ships from Santa Cruz to Protugal last January hat two of our galleys and twelve galleots fought bravely with the blacks near Goa. The galleots withdrew into a harbour twelve miles from Goa, whither the Governor dispatched a fleet. This fleet conquered the coast and drove the natives inland.
    The fortress which our Armada destroyed in Malcca has been built up anew by the people there. The Governor, however, with three hundred Portuguese, once more drove the people away and tore down the building. All the ports of Malacca are of great importance, for it is thither the ships come to take in cargoes of pepper and other condiments and freight. It would be well to conquer the island of Sumatra. With four to six thousand Protuguese it would be possible to prevent all navigation to Moqua. The money, however, is lacking. Last year an English ship entered the Sunda Straits and took in a load of pepper. The captain had brought with him a letter and a present to the Bishop there, but the latter accepted neither. When the English made their way back towards England round the Cape of Good Hope they sailed forth with two more ships and took their course through the Estrecho de Moqua, where one of the ships was wrecked. With the other two they proceeded to New Spain and Mexico where they pillaged and took whatever they could lay their hands upon. From thence they sailed to the Philippines, where they loaded all manner of wares from China. One ship then sailed home, and another to the Sunda Straits to fetch a cargo of pepper. Navigation from New Spain to China has become an ordinary occurrence. Ships arrive there daily. Last year Don Juan de Gona sailed to Mexico, but when our Governor learnt of this he sent a galleot to fight him, for it would be India’s ruin if he were allowed free passage. For there is a convention between the King of Portugal and the King of Spain according to which the Spaniards are not allowed to sail to the Philippines. By this the King, our Lord, vowed he would abide when he took possession of Portugal.
    The Jesuits daily convert people in Japan to the Christian Faith. They have entire mastery of this island.
    The Moors of Ceylon have taken a Christian for their king. He is the cousin of the last King. He asks for two hundred monks who are to baptize his subjects.

146. Further Successes by Bragadini
        Venice
        26 January 1590
    Concerning the alchemist, Mamugnano, no one harbours doubts any longer about his daily experiments in changing quicksilver into gold. It was realized that his craft did not go beyond one pound of quicksilver, however much various persons begged him to produce more. Thus the belief is now held that his allegations to produce a number of millions have been a great fraud, in which he caused people to believe. For he who can make a small amount of gold should also be able to produce a large quantity. This is the question upon which learned professors hold dispute. Meanwhile he has cut down his expenses, also reduced his banqueting, and is seen about with a smaller suite than formerly. It is reported from Spain that the King has concluded an agreement with the Genoese for a loan of five millions towards the end of the months of March and April, one million during the middle of July and the last during the middle of September.
            Venice, 26 January 1590
    The alchemist Mamugnano is making gold here for his needs. He is intending this Shrovetide to hold a joyous masque in the Square of St. Stephen, for which purpose he is having sent hither six fine stallions from Mantua.

146-147. Printing of the Bible for the Heathen
        Rome
        26 January 1590
    The Pope has learned with particular satisfaction that the Grand Duke of Florence is willing to have the books of the Bible printed here at his expense in the Chaldean, Arabic, Syrian and Ethiopian languages, and to have them expedited to these countries. These people have complained that hitherto they had to live in blindness for the lack of biblical writings and they demand to be instructed in the Christian Faith.

147. Adultery at the Court of Saxe-Coburg
        Strasburg
        17 February 1590
    John Casimir is said to be in sore trouble concerning his consort, for she has committed adultery with a Pole. The latter has had intercourse with her seven or eight times, and upon each occasion she presented him with a hundred crowns. When these things became bruited abroad, he was taken into strict custody to the Palace of Mannehim, about two miles distant from the city of Worms. Not long age he escaped, but was caught again in the palatinate. By order of the said Duke, several hundredweight of iron were fastened to his person, so that he may not be able to flee again. May God console him and all such as are afflicted!
    The Princess has been divested of all her princely apparel and raiment. She is reported to be wearing the clothing of one of her former tiring women and to be in durance no less hard than her lover. Only an old woman is let in to her.
    Otherwise information has been received that the alchemist of Venice has been instigated by the Grand Vizier to pass himself off as an alchemist and an artist in order thus to gain admittance to the city of Venice. This scheme has been, however, discovered, and the alchemist will not escape punishment.

147-148. Genoese Money for the League
        Venice
        9 February 1590
    Tidings come from France that the Spinolas, wealthy Genoese merchants who did a large business in Paris, have collected a goodly part of the moneys owing to them from such countries as France, England and the Netherlands. Finding themselves possessed in Paris of so large a sum in cash as near on four hundred thousand crowns, they dared not remove it, because they were afeared that it might be taken from them. Still less did they wish to take it to Italy or Spain because trade there is at a standstill. They are now offering this sum to the League, and His Royal Majesty of Spain has promised its repayment in Spain. In Rouen there are other Spanish merchants, who possess a still larger fortune, which they also wish to offer to the League.
    It is said that Mamugnano has won near on ten thousand ducats gambling with several noblemen, so that rumour hath it that he is as clever at gambling as at making gold. He is reported to have produced in these latter days ten thousand gold crowns at one sitting, which fact is confirmed by a credible witness, who was present on that occasion.

148. Attempt to Poison Philip II
        Venice
        6 April 1590
    Aa terrifying miracle, so they say, has occurred in Spain. One morning, as the King after praying in his oratory before a crucifix, which he held in great devotion, as was his daily custom, wished to kiss the image of Christ, the latter turned away from him. This greatly horrified and frightened the King and he once more began to pray that God might forgive him his sins. He thereupon once more tried to kiss the image of Christ, which again withdrew from him. When the King had perceived this with great concern and affliction, he sent for his Father Confessor, to whom he related this miracle. The latter then began praying to God that He might reveal this secret unto him. When he had concluded his prayers, he told the King to send for two of his most eminent councillors and bid them kiss the crucifix. They did so and soon thereafter fell sick and died. Some aver that the crucifix was poisoned so that the King might lose his life thereby.

148-149. Execution of Two Children
        Vienna
        24 April 1590
    Yesterday two boys, the one thirteen and the other seventeen years of age, were put to death by fire and sword. For some time they had caused much damage through setting fire to property. May God guard henceforth all the children of pious parents!

149. Another Burning of Witches
        Schwab-München
        4 May 1590
    Last Wednesday the innkeeper’s wife of Möringen and the baker’s wife of Bobingen were tried here for their misdeeds in witchcraft. Mine hostess is a short, stout, seventy-year-old doxy, who had taken to her accursed witchery when eighteen years of age. This she has practised fifty-two years, and it is easy to imagine what havoc she has wrought in such a long time. As the result of fervent petitioning, her sentence has been lightened inasmuch as she was first strangled and then only burned.
    The other was only seduced to this work of the Devil by Ursula Krämer, who was the first to be executed here. So far, she has not perpetrated any sore misdeeds, but so much has she owned to, that her life is forfeit. Even on her day of judgment she still thought she could vindicate herself, and even at the place of execution I myself heard her say that she was dying innocent. Most unwillingly did she submit to her fate. But in the end she was reconciled to it and prayed long to God that He might pardon her misdeeds.
    This morn another woman was brought hither from Möringen. Only half a year ago she married off one of her sons to a widow, who is said to be of the same craft. Thus it is hoped that it may incriminate others here. To-morrow or next week some more are to be brought here, but no one knows from whence. There is much discussion here about the hostess of Göggingen. May the Lord grant that this be but idle talk.

149-150. Fresh Deeds of the Alchemist of Venice
        Venice
        11 May 1590
    Whereas Mamugnano, the alchemist, passed some time in a village a certain distance from here, and several persons suspected him of making gold for other people, his rooms were sealed at the request of his creditors. By order of the Signori Capitani, however, one room was unsealed again.
    During the last days a large fish was caught by the fishers near Malamocco. It weighs more than a thousand pounds, according to our weights, and measures twenty spans. It has two wide wings, eyes as large as those of an ox, and a round, small mouth with two teeth, one in the upper and one in the lower jaw. They are almost as thick as a finger and the fish has a strange colour. What kind of a fish it is the fishermen are as yet unable to say.
    We have just learned that Mamugnano, the alchemist, has returned here. The Pope is said to have granted him absolution, but he had to make a donation of five thousand crowns and enter the Order of the Knights of Malta.

150-152. A Miracle in Bohemia
        Prague
        6 July 1590
    In the town of Kaurim in this kingdom of Bohemia, five miles from here, there lives in the house of a widow a God-fearing, industrious man, Nicholas by name, with his wife and three small children. He was so poor that he had naught but four pennies. With these he went to a baker’s on the morning of the 22nd of May and bought a loaf of bread. Carrying this home, he wondered oft, mid heavy sighing, how he should be able to provide further for himself, his wife and the children. He therefore entreated God in his heart that He might graciously maintain and feed them. He thereupon divided the load among the children, but after a little while they again demanded food. However, he neither had any money nor knew how it could be obtained, so he sent out his wife to borrow a few loaves of bread, but she accomplished nothing and came home with empty hands. Thereupon the man decided to go and dig loam which he might sell for money or barter for bread. He took a small pickaxe, and leaving the town behind, went to Brandschech Farm, near a village named Strzebovle, which belongs to the town kaurim. As he reached the road near the estate of Herr Johann Lanna, Imperial Judge in the town of Kaurim, he discovered loam near it and thrust his pickaxe several times into the ground. Upon this, four large lumps of a snowy white substance were disclosed. He gathered these up and brought them home to his spouse, but was not aware as yet that they were flour. He ordered her to obtain as much bread for it as she could. She was absent a long while, as many people were greatly astonished, and some of them recognized this to be exceeding good flour. Since the aforesaid Nicholas waxed impatient and would no longer await the return of his wife, he set forth once more, taking with him a large napkin. After he had dug for a little while, he again found a great quantity of the white substance. He deposited it in the napkin and he had hardly begun to heap it on the cloth when the cloth was full, as he himself testifies. He thereupon carried it home. When he returned, his wife informed him that what he had found was not loam, but right good flour. He showed it to may people, who all recognized it as flour and bought it from him in lumps. Several gentlemen of the Council partook of it, and dumplings and baby’s pap ere also made therefrom. The bread is beautifully white, is of a sweet and agreeable flavour and of the fragrance of orris-root.
    When this occurrence became know, many people went to visit the poor man and found his story to be true. The bailiffs, however, feared that the people might injure the corn, and therefore erected a fence around the place where the hole had been dug. In spite of this, many came from the cities, villages and hamlets to witness the miracle. They dug lumps out of the soil, small and large. Some poor people collected it in barrels. The flour is clean, and contains no earth or loam and easily separates from these substances. It is also slightly moist and holds together until it be exposed to the sun. It is of benefit to those who are God-fearing and especially such as use it for their own sustenance or that of their children. But, when unbelievers or scoffers touch it, it turns to sand. If it is allowed to drop to the earth, it becomes very white. The flour has also been brought hither, and many honourable persons have seen it with their own eyes and touched it with their own hands. They have thanked God profoundly for His boundless Wisdom and Mercy. May He feed those who are in poverty and of a believing heart now and through all Eternity!

152-154. Letter from Japan
unknown
        25 July 1590
            background: From a letter written by Ægidius Matta, Priest of the Society of Jesul to the General of his Order concerning the progress of Christianity.
    King Sapume, hitherto the most embittered enemy of the Christian Faith, demands that one of our brethren, who have come hither from the Spanish Philippines, be sent to Kangoxima, the most important harbour of his whole kingdom (whence I am writing), in order to hear confessions, preach and instruct his subjects. He also wishes that we found a settlement in the aforesaid port. He first did greatly insist upon this, but now has agreed to defer the matter till the arrival of the Father Inspector.
    P. Caspar Celius, Vice-Provincial for Japan, who has lived the life of a saint and died immaculate, was taken to his grave in solemn state. This was marked not only by the numerous attendance of our Fathers, who chanced at this time to be present here, but by the presence of many Thomus-Christians who followed the funeral to Arima, where he was buried. His successor is Pater Gometius, who, despite his delicate health, is held in no less esteem than the departed. Concerning the position of Christianity in Japan, it is to be reported that three years have now passed since our Order was banished from this country. But by the protection of God we have met with no hindrance as the result of this banishment. Also the number of Christians in spite of this has not decreased, but, on the contrary, increased at a quicker rate than at the time when the Tyrant pretended to favour our doings. Several members of the nobility have become Christians and vie with their subjects in Christian zeal. D. Augustinus, a Christian, a vassal of the Tyrant, himself converted the Prince of Gotti to the Faith. It is of no mean advantage to the state of Christendom, that the islands upon which the said Christians are living, are situate far from the trading route of the Chinese. For this reason, also, all those who instruct in the Faith are removed far from the danger of a rebellion.
    Nevertheless, in towns which are in closer proximity to the Chinese, such as Arima and Omura, the secrets of our Faith have been taught at all times openly and fearlessly and that with great success. In proof whereof there is the multitude of those who received the Blessed Sacrament. Apart from this, many crucifixes have been erected at various places, and frequented by servants of the Tyrant, without their being mutilated or pulled down. There are not many persons either who would easily consent to denounce us to the Tyrant, for they do not wish to cause him any annoyance, since he prefers to avoid trouble where he can. He likewise has the habit of passing things over in silence—although they be well known to him—when they appear to be vexatious.
    The penalty of banishment is not so severely carried out in the case of the Japanese as it occasionally is elsewhere. It is therefore less strange, that we, though we be banished, yet continue our work with little hindrance. For all things that follow appear to the Japanese as banishment: the deprivation of the sight of that Mighty One, who has expelled us, and the avoidance of places that are greatly frequented, and the exhibition of grief and mourning in demeanour and attire, and a life fashioned on that of the Bonzes.
    But now I revert again to the progress which Christianity has made here. One Ethnicus, or First Lord of the name of Taikosama, a most violent enemy of Christianity, has not been able to hinder the spread of the Faith in his territory. Churches and crucifixes have been erected and all the inhabitants of a not unimportant town were baptized by me. A church was also built in many places—not only in those of great importance—and crosses were erected although the full time does not seem as yet at hand. Moreover a large number of those who have so far besieged our Port of Kangoxima now demand to be baptized. Further, also several Ethnici, who have been held prisoners by the Christians at various places, are also admitted to Holy Baptism, so that once the Tyrant Taikosama has been vanquished, we cherish the great hope—please God—that all those persons will adopt the Christian Faith. Our Ethnici here can scarcely recover from their wonderment at perceiving how little, if at all, we, who have been banished by the order of the Tyrant, allow ourselves to be frightened by his ordinances. Even three of the Thomi Ethnici extol our innocence, because, although all counsel us to do so, we cannot be prevailed upon to travel to China, leaving one or the other behind, in order to escape the present persecution.
    They say it seems as though we were being detained by Providence, likewise as if we were endeavouring through our safety to demonstrate the might of God, Whose messengers we claim to be, as against the power of His enemies. As is men’s custom they have taken this into their heads and firmly believe that we draw our strength from the enemies of Taikosama, so that our banishment from Japan may be rendered the more difficult. The Tyrant will imagine the same, when he hears that we are still in Japan.
    We take credit to ourselves for hoping for the best. In the seminaries, which were instituted by Gregory XIII in Japan, a multitude of helpers grows day by day. This will be of the greatest importance for the growth of the Faith when Christianity is once more tolerated in these islands.

154-155. Famine in Paris
        Lyons
        11 August 1590
    Although it was hoped that we should know before ending this letter how matters stand in the city of Paris, there have been no reliable tidings from that city since the 15th day of July. At this date, the Parisians still held out, but it is said that the troops of Navarre stormed the Faubourg St. Antoine on the 19th day of July. The Duc de Mayenne is reported to have received four thousand infantry and six hundred horse from the Netherlands together with a regiment of lansquenets from Lützelburg. There is great hunger in Paris; a pound of white bread costs half a crown; mutton, fore or hind part, legs or quarters for roasting, five crowns; ox or cow, one hundred and forty crowns; six sheep, one hundred crowns; a pound of horseflesh, five sous. Rumour has it that people are eating mice, cats and dogs, and also that wine is very dear.

155. Frightful Apparition in the Sky at Vienna

        11 August 1590
    These days at 10 o’clock at night a most alarming wonder has manifested itself in the skies. The firmament was rent asunder and through this gap one could distinguish chariots and armies, riders with yellow, white, red and black standards, moving as though to do battle against each other. This awesome and unusual vision continued from ten at night till about two of the morning, and was witnessed with alarm and dismay by many honest and trustworthy people. The significance thereof is known but to God Almighty, Who may graciously prevent the shedding of innocent blood.

155-156. The Plague in Rome
        Rome
        15 August 1590
    Since the month of July eight thousand people have perished from the plague which hath broken out in this city. One of the brothers of our Governor died during one of these last days, also his wife, who departed this life only two hours before him. They were buried together. A great number likewise have died in Pisa, and because of the great mortality in Leghorn only a few are left there, for many have fled.

156. Fear of the Witches in Suabia
        Schwab-München in the Bishopric of Augsburg
        30 August 1590
    Since the execution here of the two sorceresses, two more were brought hither from Wehringen as prisoners. This village is first to be cleansed of this vermin before a start is made here or elsewhere. It is said that there are not many already been put to death. If once they but make a beginning here, there will be work for some time, especially if matters be allowed to proceed with such lack of diligence as hitherto. But where you dwell there are many who might be caught, if only you willed it so, but the right spirit is lacking. Be that as it may, let the authorities take care how they justify one day their action before God.

156-157. Mighty Earthquakes in Vienna
        Vienna
        16 September 1590
    I cannot hide from thee that great havoc was wrought here by an earthquake which began yesterday at 5 o’clock in the afternoon. It shook the houses in the whole of the town and lifted the people bodily into the air. At midnight it caused several houses to collapse and killed various persons. Much brickwork and large pieces of masonry were hurled from the steeples of the Churches of St. Stephen, St. Michael and the Church of Our lady. Likewise in the royal residence it made stones, fragments, bricks and chimneys to split and break off. The roofs remained intact. The Schottenkirche is half destroyed. There was great terror among the populace, and it looked as though the Day of the Last Judgment was upon us.
    The damage amounts to many thousand florins. At 2 o’clock after midnight there was another earthquake which was not so terrific. The people fled from the houses into the streets. A learned man, whose name is unknown, is said to have predicted that there will soon follow a much more terrible earthquake. May God have mercy upon us.
    The lady of high rank who was possessed of the devil was exorcized yesterday in the Schottenkirche and thereafter became quite a reasonable creature. Last week when the priest was working upon her she remained in a trance for about an hour and life seemed extinct. When she came to herself she spoke many things that were passing strange and began to call out: “Woe, woe unto you Regents of Austria, woe unto Pappenheim, woe to the city of Pressburg, for it will be burned to the ground. Woe unto the city of Vienna, for it will perish!”  She also related that the Angel Gabriel led her to the gates of hell and showed to her the souls of the condemned and their tortures. She pretends to have seen many great men, in particular Martin Luther, who pitifully cries out anent his teachings and sermons.

157. The Spread of Christendom in Japan
        Rome
        30 September 1590
    The General of the Order of Jesuits has latterly submitted a satisfactory report to the Pope with reference to Japanese affairs and the growth of Christianity in that country. Although the Jesuits have had to endure throughout many years grievous persecution from the unbelievers, they have finally succeeded in happily prevailing upon the King to recall them to his side and to grant them free and safe conduct throughout his kingdom, although he himself has not adopted the Christian Faith.

157-159. Disturbances in Prague
        Prague
        24 December 1590
    During the past day a clamour was raised here that the Jesuits and the priests of the Pope are minded to take by force several churches of the Hussites on Christmas Eve, and retain them for the purpose of holding their services therein. It was also rumoured that the Jesuits have received outfits for war for some hundred men and have hidden them in their College. This alarm was raised by a monk, who said that he was awarded by the late Pope the privilege of obtaining possession of the monastery and church of St. Emaus, together with its revenue and appurtenances. This outcry came to the ears of His Imperial Majesty, who ordered inquiries to be made with reference to the matter. It has transpired that several artisans had spoken thus during a carousal. At the order of His Majesty they were examined by the councillors of the city of Prague. They were sent to court and questioned from whom they held such information. It resulted in a tanner being charged with spreading the rumour. He was put in prison in the Altstadt where he was questions in kindly manner, but later put to the rack, as to where he had first heard these tales. But he pleaded ignorance. His journeymen were called and testified that he voiced such opinions before even they had partaken any wine. The aldermen condemned him to be executed with the sword. They submitted the sentence to the Emperor and asked him whether they should carry it out.
    His Majesty issued a proclamation in the Bohemian language which was exhibited in all public places and, to some extent, has pacified the people, who were in an ugly temper. At first they had armed for resistance, although they had no grounds for so doing. In all parts of Prague there broke out disturbances. It has been ordered that a number of burgesses hold night-watch in all the suburbs of Prague. Likewise, a house-to-house visitation was carried out in order to ascertain how many strange guests there be with each citizen, how named, from whence, and of what nature their business. This had to be reported to His Majesty. Moreover, it was ordained that whosoever should know or hear of any danger should give tidings thereof to His Majesty or the Council. This scheme may lead to great bloodshed, theft and pillaging, if by chance a daring murderer or robber make use of this rumour to start an outcry and raise disorder in the town of Prague.

159. Attempt to Poison the King of Poland
        Vienna
        4 January 1591
    It is reported here that latterly King Maximilian was nearly murdered by a Pole, who tendered him poisoned wine. When His Majesty had ended his meal and asked for a drink, the cellarer, as is the usage, poured the wine out of the bottle, partook thereof and filled the drinking vessel which the royal cup-bearer held out to him. The latter tasted the wine and was immediately thereon taken ill, so that His Majesty had the wine removed. The royal cup-bearer fell to the ground in the pangs of death. This caused great consternation, for it is to be assumed that the malefactor made use of a very potent poison. It is surmised that the drinking-cup alone was poisoned, because the cellarer felt no ill effect after partaking of the wine. The Lord Almighty has doubtlessly graciously guarded our God-fearing Master. The Polish miscreant, however, waited in the Neustadt outside the castle in order to learn the outcome of his deed. He was shortly thereupon cast into prison, but owing to careless supervision, made his escape, for which the civic judge will have to answer.

159-160. A Case of Moral Compulsion in Salzburg
        Salzburg
        3 February 1591
    Five citizens were recently ordered to the Town Hall. There it was pointed out to them that His Highness the Bishop had commanded that every one who desired to live or dwell here should go to Confession and partake of Holy Communion at the appointed seasons. But since they had neglected to do so, His Highness was forced to treat them in different fashion and to punish them on account of their disobedience. For that reason were they detained that day and night at the Town Hall. Upon the ensuing day about 8 o’clock they were led by four halberdiers to the parish church, carrying lighted tapers. In the church they had to remain kneeling, holding the lighted candles until the sermon was well finished. The priest thundered and stormed against the heretics in truly ferocious manner. After the sermon, they were taken to the cathedral where they had to remain  kneeling throughout the saying of Mass. Thereafter they were permitted to return home.
    But it is reported of one of these burgesses that afterwards in a tavern, having drunk more than his fill, he made merry thereof. This came to the ears of the Bishop and the latter had him tickled with fifteen strokes of the birch.

160. Splendid Handicraft in Strasburg
        Strasburg
        15 February 1591
    Work upon the organ in our cathedral has been proceeding now for three-quarters of a year. The organ is intended to be a masterpiece. It possesses eight thousand and several hundred pieces and eighteen stops. The largest pipes are fourteen aam across to the mouth-piece. This has been ascertained by measuring.

160-161. Alchemists at the Imperial Court
        Prague
        14 May 1591
    The English alchemist, who has recently been taken to Pürglitz as a prisoner, appeared to be in the depths of despair these latter days and refused to partake of food, so that it was feared that he might die. But he has since recovered. His Imperial Majesty has ordered a doctor and a councillor of the Court to proceed to him, in order to examine him. Various other officers were also sent with orders to extract information, if need be, by torture. Although Herr Peter von Rosenberg has arrived here in place of his brother to find out what were the grounds for the accusations against the alchemist, he has as yet been unable to get at the rights of the matter. Some are of the opinion that Herr von Rosenberg would petition for the release of the alchemist, but it is said that the opposing faction is too strong.

161. Rising in Saragossa
        Saragossa
        15 May 1591
    Of news we have little that is good. To-day Antonio Perez, the King’s secretary, was taken from the prison to the Holy Office. Thereupon the population of the whole town rose in arms with shouts of ‘Liberty." More than six thousand armed men forgathered, went to the house of the Count of Almenara, and broke down the gates, so that it became urgent to still the wrath of the multitude. This was done by the Justices of Aragon, who led the Count from his house on foot. The populace assailed him in such wise that it is a miracle that he was not torn to pieces. During this frightful affray, the Count received two wounds. He was taken to jail amid the shouting of the people, who wanted to put him to death as a traitor. Thereafter they all precipitated themselves into the court of the Inquisition, demanding the release of Antonio Perez and declaring that otherwise they would kill the Inquisitors. Two servants of the Inquisition were fired upon and perished. This riot lasted until the Viceroy and the Arch-bishop ordered that the secretary should be taken back to prison. There he remains and so the fury of the populace has somewhat abated.
    The Archbishop has been in grave danger. For, although several counts and other noblemen came to comfort him, his life was not safe. I stood before him with a crucifix and perceived how sorely he was afflicted by this affair. We had the intention to hie to the Cathedral to fetch the Blessed Sacrament in order to assuage the fury of the population. But we feared that there might be attempts made on our lives and that of the Archbishop, for two of the Archbishop’s servants who had been sent to the Cathedral were stoned.

162. An Interrupted Procession in Vienna
        Vienna
        11 June 1591
    About eight or ten days ago there was made a loud outcry that bandits and such like rabble would cause a disturbance and commit pillage and murder. The inhabitants of the houses were also warned to make ready and to hasten to their appointed places on the stroke of the bell. Thus every one has been in great torment and has armed himself to the utmost and got himself in readiness, so that no powder was to be bought in the whole of the town. On the day of the Procession of Corpus Christi many people remained in their dwellings, harbouring great fear because the Archduke remained at Ebersdorf and did not come into the city. When, therefore, upon the said day of St. Stephen a shot was fired in the Singerstrasse, a rapscallion raised a loud cry that there was a might disturbance in the Imperial stables. Thereupon such terror seized the people on account of the shooting that they began to run hither and thither, knocking down and trampling each other under foot. They lost their cloaks, hats and weapons, and many hundreds took refuge in the Spitalkirche. They were all so affrighted that they but gazed at each other and were unable to utter a single word. This panic, however, promptly subsided and no one is able to adduce its cause or origin. In the rush many threw away their flags and banners. The clergy remained unaffected, otherwise we should have witnessed a pretty comedy. I take it as an ill omen and for a warning and constigation of God. May He graciously guard us!

162-163. Harsh Durance for the Alchemist Kelley
        Prague
        2 July 1591
    The English alchemist is reported to have been immured at Pürglitz. He is to have no air, but that which comes through a hole, through which he can reach for his food bit by bit. It is feared that it will be done with him as with the alchemist at Munich. On examining the accounts of Rosenberg it was found that the Englishman had cost him over three hundred thousand florins. It is amazing that these noblemen have allowed themselves to be duped in such fashion. He is said to have cost the Emperor near on a thousand Rhenish guilders.

163. A Miracle in Bourges
        Venice
        2 August 1591
    There are shown here replicas of the crosses which appeared in Bourges in France in the church of St. Mary upon the cloths and coverings of the altars and upon the vestments, as well as on the cowl of a monk, as he was preaching. They are square in shape and of the size of a half-crown in gold. Because the heretics would give no credence in such miracles, these little crosses appeared on the ruffs of different laymen and women. Although one is disposed to regard this miracle as a warning of God to the Catholics on account of their sins, there are many others who take it to be a happy omen of victory; it is of common knowledge that such a sign appeared to Constantine in presage of his victory against Maxentius.

163. Death of Pope Gregory XIV
        Rome
        19 October 1591
    After every possible remedy had been employed to avert the Pope’s illness, his strength and speech presently forsook him. He departed this life on Tuesday last at 7 o’clock in the palace of San Marco, where he had his abode. Although it was late at night, the Chief Chamberlain, Cardinal Gaetano, was sent for to come to San Marco. He ordered the Papal Seal to be broken and took into custody all papers and documents, as is the custom at the death of the Pope. He also made all dispositions with regard to the body. The latter was opened in the presence of the physicians and it is said that the right lung was affected and that the kidneys were full of black and decayed blood. A gallstone was found likewise, the size of a hen’s egg and weighing two ounces. On the Wednesday in the early hours of the morning the corpse was accompanied to the palace by the Pope’s nephews and his most intimate friends, the Swiss Guard and the light cavalry. The Pope lay in state in the Capella Vaticana, from whence the Canons of St. Peter fetched him and took him to their church, where he still lies, so that the people may kiss his foot as is their wont.
    
164-165. Election of Pope Innocent IX
        Rome
        2 November 1591
    On the morning of the past Sunday, the 27th day of October, which day had been fixed for the entering into Conclave, Mass was said at the usual place in the Chapel of St. Peter. Cardinal Gesualdo, as Deacon of the Sacred College, celebrated the Mass of the Holy Ghost and the Bishop of Bergamo delivered a solemn address. Thereupon the Cardinals entered in procession into Conclave—and this was only closed at 16 o’clock at night, in order that they could be provided with everything that was needful to them. On the Sunday the Cardinals held a congregation in the Capella Paulina. There the fourth Papal Bull with regard to the Pope’s election was read out and the Custodian and the civic officers had to take the oath of allegiance and obedience until such time as the new pope should be elected. The other relates and ministers were instructed to guard the Conclave with the utmost care.
    The ambassadors of the various sovereigns did not omit to remind the Cardinals at this time of their several interests. It was rumoured on the ensuing day that Cardinal Madrucci had said that for divers reasons he felt that he could not become pope and wished therefore that no notice should be taken of his name, but that the claims of those only should be considered, whose election demanded less thought and deliberation.
    On the Monday morning, the customary ballot (Scrutinium) began. Cardinal San Quatro received twenty-seven votes. Upon the Tuesday the second ballot was taken in which San Quatro received twenty-eight votes. This caused alarm to those who liked him not; those, however, who favoured him felt greatly hopeful. After the midday meal a public Practica was arranged in order that his election might be brought to a close. Towards the twenty-third hour this was finally decided and by the Act of Adoration, with the consent of all the Cardinals, he was made pope. Thereupon they led him to the Capella Paulina and then, with the usual ceremonial, to St. Peter’s. He has assumed the name of Innocent IX.
    It is clearly evident that the election of this Pope must needs be a work of God, since it was completed with such rapidity. As far as human responsibility is concerned, it is to be laid at the door of Cardinal Mendoza, the head of the Spanish party.
    The Pope is seventy-three years of age, and although frail and delicate of body, may yet live a great many years. He has adopted Signore Cesare Facchinetto, his sister’s son, as his own. The latter has himself sons and daughters, who will be the first to rejoice in the good fortune of the Pope. The Pope is held to be a Roman native, because he has always sojourned here since the days of Pope Paul III.
    It is expected of him that his rule will be one of beneficence. The Pope has endeavoured during these days to provide the town with supplies of grain. He is also said to harbour a great desire to exterminate the bandits here. To-morrow, Sunday, on the 3rd day of the month, he is to be crowned, according to his wish, in all privacy.

165-166. News from Russia and Moldavia
        Prague
        12 November 1591
    We have tidings here that the two brothers in Moscow have fallen out on account of the ruling of the country, and are waging war upon one another. Thereupon the Great Khan of Tartary has invaded this country with an army more than one hundred thousand strong and devastated it. But, meanwhile, as the younger brother has died, the elder has combined both armies and beaten the Khan of the Tartars, killing eighty thousand men. The Khan escaped with only three thousand men, the others were dispersed.
    From Kaschau we receive a letter, dated the 1st day of November, reporting the arrival thither of the Wojwode Petrus, who has escaped from Moldavia, bringing with him much stately property and over two hundred followers. He had with him one hundred waggons and twelve camels laden with jewels and gold. He arrived in Szatmar with his youthful son, but gave his people leave to return home. He camps for the nonce two miles from Bartfeld where he would like to winter. He has communicated this wish to His Majesty and awaits his gracious permission so to do. This Petrus is a fine, hoary old nobleman, he has ruled long over the land and since it is exceeding rich, he has amassed wealth untold. When the Grand Turk learnt of his great fortune, he intended to have him strangled, but the Wojwode became aware of this fell purpose in good time, and escaped, fleet of foot, with his treasure, his councillors and chancellors. Where he will settle ultimately we shall see.

166-167. Festivities at the Court of Dresden
Dresden
        1591
            background: Concerning the recent Christening of the child of the Elector of Saxony and the accompanying festivities.
    The tilting-ground at the palace of the Elector in Dresden has been prepared in such magnificent and gay fashion, as I have never beheld before. The seats have been covered throughout with sprigs of green fir, and between the arches and the lists there have been dug into the ground about one hundred mighty and lofty firs. These were daintily hung with fine oranges, pomegranates, large pumpkins and other luscious fruit. All kinds of large and small live birds fluttered about betwixt the fir-trees. Likewise many red and black squirrels flitted continually from one tree to the other. His Grace the Elector marched up three times with his miners, to the sound of fine music and the miners’ songs. It was right wondrous to listen to these, and to see such a procession as had never been witnessed before. The last time, His Grace led one hundred huntsmen into the lists. They were all clad in green and made beautiful music, singing and blowing their horns. The huntsmen carried a very large, transparent and beautifully decorated cage, containing four bears, six boars, four wild wolves, two lynxes, several foxes, many hares and other small animals, such as martens, badgers, squirrels, rabbits and wild fowl. These were released on the tilting-ground, and whosoever contrived to catch one of them was allowed to keep it. The four bears, the wild boars, the wolves and the lynxes were let loose in the tilting-ground, where they roamed to and fro. The people stood in the courtyard. But the dogs kept good guard over the animals and the people took no harm. Only the wild boars charged among the populace and many fell to the ground. But the dogs gave them no quarter, so that, thanks be to God, no one was hurt.
    The jousts were continued throughout four days. The mantenators were barons. The races were run for money. The sponsors were the Elector of Brandenburg, his spouse and the Administrator; the latter, however, was unable to be present because he had fallen from his horse when attempting to tilt at the ring, and broken his shoulder blade. But by good fortune he was not greatly injured and he is right well once more. The Landgrave, Maurice of Hesse, the old Duke of Brunswick, Philip by name, and a Count von Rolinz were also sponsors. Otherwise no strange guests have we had here.
    His Grace the Elector has had the little Princess christened, omitting the exorcisms. This has highly pleased the Calvinists and it looks as though a change of religion would occur here.

168. Death of Queen Elizabeth of France
        Vienna
        25 January 1592
    Of news all I have to impart is that Mistress Elizabeth, Queen of France and Archduchess of Austria, peacefully passed away in the Lord on the Wednesday past at 11 o’clock of the night. May God grant rest to her soul! Although for the length of forty-five days she had been woefully racked by palpitation and stinging pains at the heart, the physicians were unable to find a remedy for alleviating these. As she felt especial longing for a sight of His Majesty, her most beloved brother, His Majesty had arrived the previous night by mail coach with but a few horses. His arrival caused the Queen no little joy in her great suffering before her end. Of the arrival and departure of His Majesty there were very few informed, with the exception of the court officials. On the occasion of this demise all festivities and music were forbidden in this town, at the risk of strict punishment for the contravention of this order.
    Upon the following Thursday throughout the day every one, rich and poor alike, was allowed to view this pious Queen. Many thousands of persons came and went. The Queen was held in very high esteem, especially by the poor, to whom she had shown great kindness and given bounteous alms. His Imperial Majesty left for Prague again on the following morn.

168-169. Disputes between Calvinists and Lutherans
        Frankfort
        12 February 1592
    We are advised thus from Leipzig: The common mob of artisans and shop-apprentices have caused a riot following upon the death a few days ago of Christianus Schütz. He was formerly Chaplain-in-Ordinary at the Court of Dresden. He was dismissed during the lifetime of Duke August, because of his adherence to Calvinism. The crowd ran with yells and clamour to the house of the deceased and broke the windows of the afflicted widow, shouting therewhile that he should be buried under the gallows. He and his following had caused the death of the young princely offspring and the common folk likewise regarded their destitution as due to him. Since the demise of our Sovereign of blessed memory near on seventeen hundred persons have been dismissed; this has caused a large number of wicked and evil-minded ruffians to be about. As the persons living in Schüt’s house feared to be molested by that vulgar concourse, the widow of the Elector had to post halberdiers in and outside the house, so that order might be maintained till the funeral. When this was about to take place the next day there was no one to be found willing to carry the deceased to his grave. He had, therefore, to be laid upon a cart and drawn by a horse. Some rapscallions then banded themselves together, causing such clamour with howling, yelling and whistling that it defies description. They pelted the mourners, of whom there were few, with mud so that these had perforce to retire.
    Another case occurred here this week. Dr. Gunderman, formerly pastor in this town, was cast into prison at the castle a few weeks ago. His wife was greatly mortified thereat. She was on the point of confinement and was seized by such melancholia that she hanged herself on the roasting spit of the kitchen. These will be terrible tidings for the doctor when he comes to hear of them.

169-170. War upon the Bandits in the Papal State
        Rome
        14 March 1592
    A few days ago a father and his son who had given refuge to the bandits were arrested and taken to the Castello.
    The bandits had given chase to the new Nuncio for Naples, Monsignor Aldobrandini, in such wise that he had hardly been able to save himself. Only a short time ago, a day’s journey from here, they plundered a castle and a market and robbed goods worth over sixty thousand crowns. They led away with them many men and women and set fire to the market. The Pope has issued orders for the enrolment of four thousand soldiers and granted sixty thousand crowns for this purpose.

170. Birth of the Antichrist
        Venice
        14 April 1592
    This week a News-letter has been circulated here which is said to have been written by the Grand Master of Malta and divers other Christian princes. This News-letter reports that in a certain province of Babylon there has been born to a woman of evil repute a child whose father is unknown. The child is reported to be covered with cat’s hair and to be a dreadful sight. It began to talk eight days after its birth and to walk after a month. It is said to have intimated that it is the Son of God. At its birth the sun grew dark at midday and on the previous night a mighty flame of fire appeared above its house. Many mountains opened, and in one of these there was seen a column covered with Hebrew script reading: “This is the hour of my birth!”  On the next day there fell from Heaven a goodly quantity of manna and precious stones; at other places, howsoever, snakes and other horrible creatures. When the child was questioned as to the meaning of this, it made answer: that the precious stones stand for the supreme delight of those who will keep his commandments, the snakes for the martyrdom and castigation of the disobedient. Adoration of this infant has already begun because it has performed great miracles, awakening the dead and making the blind to see and the lame to walk. The populace is being encouraged by a bare-footed friar, who alleges that this is the true Son of God. For the sake of brevity I must omit further reports which do not sound very credible. It is said that the Rabbis have come to the conclusion that this is the child of Perdition, the Antichrist.

171-172. War on the Roman Bandits
        Rome
        25 April 1592
    When Mario Sciarra, the noblest chief of the bandits, arrived at a village not far from Velletri and found no victuals there, he petitioned the towns of Piceno and Norcia to supply him therewith. They sent answer that they wished to negotiate with Mario in person; but he sent one of his nephews to them, and him they shot dead. For this reason Mario went into Piceno, killing most of the inhabitants and sacking the whole place. He has also pillaged several of the neighbouring villages, and in one of them he caused the burgomaster to be hanged. In the vicinity of Tivoli, Mario Sciarra met a company of soldiers and fought with them. Thirty of their umber stood their ground and as many again were caught and hanged. This is the reprisal for refusing to recognize Sciarra as king of the Campagna. For this reason on Tuesday last Don Francesco Aldobrandino and the son of Marchese Malatesta set forth from here to Frascati with a goodly gathering of the inhabitants, and there joined forces with a number of soldiery to take the field against the bandits. They showed themselves fearlessly in the open with flying banners, drums and rack-waggons in fair number. Some were on horseback and others afoot. Near Livreto there appeared three hundred bandits who did some skirmishing with Delfino. He is reported to be sorely wounded. Leonessa in the Abruzzi, a place belonging to the Duke of Parma, was likewise invaded by the bandits, secretly assisted, so the rumour goes, by the peasantry. But, when this became known, those who had given help were thrown out of the windows as traitors to the country.
        Rome, the 9 May 1592
    The bandits who have been marauding in the Papal States for some time past, have finally made their escape in the direction of Aquila and Ascoli. Presumably the Spaniards, who were to have held the passes at the frontier, put up no resistance. The tale goes that a papal captain permitted himself to be bribed with money and allowed the bandits to escape. The Pope has issued orders that they must be refused passage throughout the Papal States, so that they do not return at the time of harvest and devastate the corn in the fields. To that end the Romans have offered to supply the money for three hundred mounted cavalry to fight them.
        Rome, 16th day of May 1592
    Last Saturday a vast number of soldiery proceeded from here to Tivoli in order there to join issue with other armies against the bandits who are making great depredations. They descended at night on Luparella in Apulia where they murdered six hundred people and the Bishop, and made off with their spoil, which is estimated at over a million. In Sessano they commandeered food and drink, driving the cattle away with them. Civitanova they burned to the ground, slaying about sixty persons. From there they pursued their way to Foggia, where they intended to steal the large sums of money that were kept at the toll-house. Had they succeeded in their enterprise they would have come away with great booty. Another band of brigands marched to Ascoli with their captain, Bachieratto, so that they might capture the Governor Visconti by night. This they failed to achieve, but they invaded a place near Montalto, where they did seventy persons to death in a gruesome fashion. Mario Sciarra is for the nonce near Norcia with a strong contingent of his bandits.

172-173. Nuptials at the Court of the King of Poland
        Cracow
        May 1592
        background: Letter concerning the Royal Wedding in Cracow, which is to be held on the 26 May 1592
    From Breslau. This day a merchant arrived here from Cracow, where he has been staying for a fortnight. He reports that the future Queen of Poland is at the time resting in Pless, but will arrive in Cracow the coming Tuesday, the 26th day of May. The Queen is diligently practising Italian dances, as the King, likewise, is being instructed therein daily by a Polish gentleman who has lived for a long time in Italy and France.
    His Majesty has ordered a masquerade which will cost over sixty thousand ducats. Fifty persons have been commanded to appear therein. They are to have their faces disguised in such fashion that each one shows that of another person and not his own, in order that none of them may be recognized. The Queen in persona will perform Italian dances, and gold-embroidered robes only will be worn for the masque.
    All the burgesses and merchants will appear in the German dress, which is in many colours. Their coats, ornamented with silver and white loops and buttons, will be a gay sight. They will all go out in procession to meet the Bible, and the nobility nor the merchants have allowed themselves to be seen arrayed thus. Six black and six white bears are to draw the bridal coach. Another coach is to be drawn by six stags. The white bears will be made to dance and thus there will be sufficient drollery with the wild animals. The merchant also reported that he had been in the King’s bedchamber. It is very spacious and the royal bedstead is in the middle thereof. It has a velvet curtain and velvet-covered chairs stand around it. On the bed there lies a sleeping-rug lined with velvet and sables. The Royal Bride is portrayed in this chamber, wearing a white and silver robe, and she looks at you with a laughing mouth, so that the King, as he looks at her picture, has to laugh likewise.

173-174. Injunction against Merry-Making
unknown
        6 October 1592
            background: Extract from an Order written by the Most Excellent Count Octavian Fugger, issued by him with regard to the abolition of all festivities.
    In the present grievous times, with death rampant, wars, disunion and tribulations, the perversion and decay of the land and the people as well as the shedding of Christian blood wax ever more disastrous. The monstrous undertakings of the Arch-Enemy of the name of Christ show that the prayers we have been offering up for the averting of these dangers and misfortunes do not suffice. It therefore behoves and well befits every one of us, as it is only meet that all should abstain from all worldly luxuries and joy. It is therefore my command that at the very earliest moment you should affix in my name (forasmuch as authority is vested in me) mandates on all the church doors with the sexton’s seal thereon, forbidding most forcibly, at the risk of chastisement, all public festivities, such as singing, whistling, dancing, masques, promenading in the streets and other worldly merry-making. For all these my permission is withdrawn until further notice. With regard to weddings, I will herewith agree to their celebration provided this be done with all modesty, to the accompaniment of muted string music. I request you to call together all priests in my name and inform them that on the Sunday on which they shall have the aforementioned mandate, it is to be affixed and published and that they are not only to read it out from the chancel, but also to exhort their parishioners seriously to live according to its injunctions. Transgressions will be punished firstly with admonitions, and should these fail with other adequate measures. With this, God speed.

175-176. Executions in Saragossa
        Saragossa
        11 November 1592
    On the 19th day of October at 5 o’clock of the evening there were executed here: Juan de Luna, Don Diego de Heredia, Francisco de Ayerbe, Dionysio Perez de San Juan and Pedro de Fuerdes. In the first place, according to old usage, they were led, all except Fuerdess, through the streets of Saragossa on horseback. Don Francisco and Don Diego were in black woollen penitential garb and long black cloaks, the horses being swathed in black saddle-cloths. Ayerbe and Dionysio Perez were also led on horseback in black penitential robes, but their steeds had no saddlecloths. Pedro de Fuerdes was dragged in advance of them on a bundle of straw by two horses. On the market-place a scaffolding had been erected out of boards, and in the midst thereof a small railing; before this they were made to kneel. This scaffolding was covered with black cloth. Don Juan de Luna had his head cut off from the front and Don Diego from the back, Ayerbe and Dionysio Perez merely had their throats cut, then they were laid down and left to die by inches. Pedro de Fuerdes they strangled with a rope. When he was dead he was quartered and the four quarters hung out in the streets of Saragossa. Don Juan de Luna’s head was affixed to the royal town hall, that of Don Diego on the city gate, that of Francisco de Ayerbe at the prison, because he had removed Perez by force from there and led him away. Don Pedro de Fuerdes’ head was fixed on one of the city gates.
    Upon the ensuring day, the 20th, the Inquisition held its examination in the market-place. This lasted from 7 o’clock in the morning until 8 o’clock in the evening. Eight people were arraigned for sedition and condemned to death. They were executed on the 24th. At the same time the portrait of Antonio Perez was brought to this trial and on account of his heresy and sodomy burnt with prisoners who had been sentenced to the stake. Besides these, twenty to twenty-five other persons from Saragossa were also tried: some of them were flogged, others expelled from the country or sent to the galleys.

176-177. The Jesuits in Prague
        Prague
        10 January 1593
    During the week that is just past a printed book has been offered here publicly for sale, which a learned Italian from Florence, of the name of Butius Fidelinius, has had printed and dedicated to His Holiness the present Pope. In this volume he adduces over a hundred probable reasons why not only the Christians, but also the Turks, the Jews, and in short all peoples, although they may not believe in Christ, shall be saved. But the Christians will most likely experience greater joys and honours after the Resurrection than the unbelievers. This book was purchased by many with great amazement and horror. Especially because he states therein that his views are likewise pleasing to several Jesuits and cardinals in France and Italy. Butius boasts that he discussed this with His Holiness the present Pope, when he was still in Poland. The opinion is held that the Jesuits should lose no time in refuting the arguments of this book. Yesterday, Sunday, one of them delivered a sermon on the Wedding Feast of Cana, and when he told all manner of good jests and stories on the subject of women’s sweetness towards men, the congregation several times laughed so loudly that he could scarcely proceed. On that account the other Jesuits are but ill pleased with him and intend to transfer him to another place. But the ladies of the Court are loth to let him depart and it is feared there may be trouble if the Jesuits persist in sending him away. He is held in high esteem by the courtiers, who last Christmas collected and presented to him so much in money, wines, spices and black Florentine cloth that it amounted to no less than twelve hundred thalers. It is desired to give him a church, St. Thomas by name, on the Kleinseite, and to expel from the monastery attached thereto all the Italian monks, especially as one of them is said to have seduced the daughter of a citizen.

179. Christening at the Court of Poland
        Warsaw
        7 July 1593
    Last Sunday, on the 4th day of this month, the royal christening was held in Warsaw after Vespers as follows: First the guests and all the officials of the Court went into the church, then the King followed. On his right hand there walked the papal Nuncio, on the left the Envoy of His Imperial Majesty. Then came the Swedish Princess, the King’s sister, who held the child in her two hands in a cradle most beautifully and daintily covered. On her right she had the Chancellor and on her left the Wojwode Adamovski. Since the Swedish lady found some difficulty in carrying her burden, the two said gentlemen assisted her. Thereupon followed the Queen. On her right walked the Envoy of Graz and on her left the Wojwode Woyzelinski, then came the young Queen, who had been confined but six weeks before; accompanied by Cardinal Count Radziwill on her right, and the Treasurer of the Polish Crown on her left. Then followed all the ladies-in-waiting of the three Queens, and as it was a beauteous day, all was most gay and sumptuous to behold. In the church the Royal Princess was given in baptism the names Anna Maria by the Cardinal Radziwill. The sponsors were: the Roman Imperial Majesty, who bestowed a necklace valued at fourteen hundred thalers as a christening gift; and the other godfather, the Envoy of Graz, who has presented, in the name of the mother of the Queen, another necklace which is nearly equal in value to the former; and the third sponsor, the old Queen, has given a bracelet and a rosary, which, surely, was of more worth than a wreath of marjoram. After the christening a short address was given, after which they all returned from church in the same order. Thereupon there took lace a private banquet which was over so promptly that every one came home by daylight.

180. Henry IV becomes a Catholic
        Lyons
        13 August 1593
    We have received tidings in what manner the King of Navarre on his birthday, the 28th day of July, was pronounced at St. Denis to be a member of the Church of Rome. Thereupon, it was urged on the Princes of the League by the common people in Paris as well as by parliament that peace should be made. Although the Spanish Ambassador and the Legate of the Pope had declaimed against this, nevertheless a general peace for three months was declared. It is supposed that peace will become effective thereafter. Preachers shout and rave against this from the chancel and make an outcry that the King will not keep faith with the Catholics. In Vivarais, Languedoc and other places round here this peace has already been hailed with great rejoicing. The King had arrived at his country seat of La Roquette near Paris, which belongs to the former Chancellor, and the Princes were agreed to come to meet him from Paris. But the Spanish Ambassador and the Papal Legate like it not and were ready to depart. A courier has been dispatched hither from Madrid reporting that the fleet from New Spain and Peru has safely reached port on the 28th of last month. The treasure is priced all in all at ten and a half millions, but nothing whatsoever is heard about the two missing ships from Calicut and the galleon from Malacca, so that it is feared that harm has come to them and that they may well be lost. This would be a great disaster to many. May God grant that good news may still be obtained with regard to them. The Spaniards and the Portuguese will then flourish exceedingly, especially if the ship that is awaited from India also arrives safely.

180-181. Trial of Herr Ladislaus von Popel
        Prague
        20 October 1593
    The day before yesterday Herr Ladislaus von Popel was cited before the Tribunal. He, however, had made his escape the night before, and, according to information, is said to have taken the road to Saxony. Yesterday in the presence of His Imperial Majesty and of all the officers sentence was pronounced upon him, in the Chamber of Knights. He is declared forfeit of life, honour and estate. This will be a sad blow to his respected and noble friends, who will also have good reason to feel it deeply. His spouse, his son and his two small daughters prostrated themselves to-day at the feet of His Majesty. But they will not achieve much, for most grievous accusations are brought forward against Herr Popel that through his fault the last Parliament was of so little profit. His Majesty is likewise in possession of the obnoxious document which he had composed.
    Postscript in another hand:
    I cannot conceal from my own kindly Master that His Imperial Majesty has begun sore quarrels and recriminations with several gentlemen on account of the self-same Diet and that he takes these unworthy matters more to heart than the war at the Hungarian frontier. The Governor is in His Majesty’s bad books. Throughout several days there has been held in the Chamber of Knights and the Hall of Justice, in the presence of His Majesty, a strict inquisition anent the originator of this state of affairs. Thus there came to be impungned a nobleman, one Wreschowetz, who put the blame on the old Herr Ladislaus Popel. His Majesty is so bitter against this nobleman that he is minded to deal very strictly with him. Kolowrat and Herr Christoph Popel have fostered this feeling greatly. When Herr Ladislaus was informed thereof he rode yesterday out of the town. To-day there is a horrible outcry anent his losing his life, his honour and his property.

181-182. Bringing in of the Turkish War Booty to Vienna
        Prague
        18 January 1594
    On the 11th of this month the booty from the victory near Weissenburg reached Vienna. It was delivered to the Court by our gentlemen thus. First came the chief of the arsenal of Raab and at his side there walked two Viennese servants. Thereupon were drawn the thirty Turkish cannon which had been taken from the enemy. Following these came three Turkish horses with gilt saddles, upholstered in velvet, whose headgear was of silver and gilt. Then were carried past the twenty-two Turkish flags, among them three principal flags with large silver and gilt buttons. Then were brought gilt sabres, daggers, morions, Janissaries’ bonnets, Turkish headgear, two marvellous bows and arrows, Turkish round shields as are worn by Begs and pashas. Likewise two long Turkish knives, two Turkish silver and gilt water bottles, ten Janissaries’ drums and many other objects. The two horses which were led out first are for the Roman Imperial Majesty, and the third is destined for the Archduke Mathias. When the cannon was installed before the Burg, a few artificers were detailed thereto. When the march past was over a cannon was fired.

182-185. Trial of Herr Georg von Popel
        Prague
        19 April 1594
    Most Honoured Gracious Sir:
    Since my last letter His Imperial Majesty has had presented to Herr Georg Popel, former Governor of Bohemia, a script, in which there were various conditions, to which he surrendered at discretion. There was likewise included an oath of peace in which was recounted what crime he had committed and what severe punishment he had deserved. This document he kept for a few days, begging that a Jesuit be called unto him, so that he might be heard in confession and make his peace with God. As the Jesuit reports to a high personage, he hath made loud protestation of his innocence during this confession on all points of which he was accused, before God, his conscience and his eternal salvation. According to this, he was not minded to burden his soul and conscience, and likewise his honour and the good name of his house, with a confession that had been forced from him. May His Majesty, as his most gracious Sovereign and Master, do with him as he pleases, for he makes most humble submission to him, and craves for mercy and compassion. Thereupon and on the same day, after going to confession. Thereupon and on the same day, after going to confession, he begged that a long petition be handed to the officers and also to the Imperial Majesty, which was composed for him by a Jesuit in Komotau, where he hath built a stately college for that Order. In this he craves that the conditions imposed upon him be graciously lightened. This petition is reported to have incensed His Imperial Majesty and the officers still further, for he recants his former confession, on the strength of which His Majesty accepted his surrender and withdrew the legal proceedings which had been begun against him. For if judgment had been pronounced, it would have cost him his life. It was decided thereupon to convey him, as a prisoner, to his castle of Litschau. There a prison was built for him, which had formerly been the dogs’ kennels. All the windows therein were walled up, and only two holes, which were guarded by double iron gratings, left at the top for the light. Around and above this jail, which consists of a small room and a closet, there has been built a passage, wherein the warders, of whom there are twenty, patrol up and down. There have also been erected two iron doors and a wooden portal so that none can go into the prison without permission from the Captain of the Guard. His name is Adam Haslauer, and some years ago he was dispossessed by Herr von Popel of his estates under the cloak of righteousness, so that he was in sore poverty and distress, and for a time had to take service at Innsbruck with the Archduke Ferdinand. The opinion is held that on account of this old enmity and the knavish treatment meted out to him by Herr von Popel, he will guard him with additional zeal and assiduity. The prison having been prepared on the night of Friday last, Popel was transported from his abode to Litschau in a coach, escorted by mounted men with sixty horses and seventy musketeers. When he came into the courtyard his old foe, the Captain, received him with but ill grace and conducted him straight to the prison. When he was about to enter, he began to weep bitterly and said: “Oh, is it not a matter for compassion, that I, poor, misfortunate man, whereas I formerly lived in honour and comfort, should now have to consume my life in the former abode of my dogs and kennel grooms, for even they were discontent with their dwelling place! It afflicts me still more that I should be delivered into the power and the hands of my former foe! Oh, what are human life, worldly pomp and riches! It is cursed avarice that hath led me astray. Yet I must grant this punishment is well merited. Howsoever, I shall be neither the last nor the first who is thus punished, and perhaps there be others who will come after me." This was understood to signify that more people are involved with him in this, and these, as is bruited about, are to be brought to justice. Five thousand thalers have been fixed yearly for the upkeep of the prison and the warders, and the prisoner has been granted daily five ordinary meals and the customary draught of wine. Nothing has yet been done to the confiscated property.
    When Herr Popel was being led away in the night, his two daughters raised exceeding bitter lamentation and wanted to depart with their father. They were granted permission to accompany him as far as Litschau. They will remain interned there a few days and then be placed in a convent until the Diet meets again. Thereafter Herr Trautson will take them into his house and have them properly educated. For His Imperial Majesty intends of his mercy to bestow on them a stately dowry from the confiscated property. Since, according to Bohemian law, it cannot be said that Herr Popel has lost his honour, whereas no judgment was pronounced against him, it is opined that there will be no aversion felt in regard to marriage with his daughters; they are said to be fine and comely maidens. This is the advantage and profit which were gained by Herr Popel when he surrendered at discretion before sentence was pronounced against him. His Majesty, however, is so much incensed at Popel’s recantation that he is willed to have the whole lawsuit and the investigations read publicly and the sentence published so that each one may hear and convince himself that His Majesty is entitled to undertake this, and far more, against him. The chief officers of the land are to gather here, even before the departure of His Majesty to make choice of another governor and a chancellor. A stadtholder will likewise be installed, because His Majesty wishes to be present in Parliament and to go to Vienna from Regensburg and then return hither again. For this affair with Popel may bring forth other difficulties still. In the last days there has been circulated a script in which it is said that one should be careful that the ashes (for this in Bohemian is the meaning of the name Popel) do not hold a few sparks from which there might spring a noxious fire for the crown of Bohemia and against the house of Austria. May God Almighty kindly guard against this. Otherwise this matter is not willingly spoken about here, for the Bohemian noblemen and those belonging to the knighthood feel somewhat affronted. There may be also some who aver that Georg Popel did everything for the good of his country and for the liberty of the Bohemian States, likewise that those in authority, in making an example of him, may have overreached themselves and infringed on the privileges of the nobles. But such people will be wary for fear that they may be made responsible hereafter.

185-186. Market Prices in Vienna
        Vienna
        17 September 1594
            List of prices of which things are to be bought nowadays in Vienna. 
    A bottle of old wine for ten Kreuzers, this year’s vintage for eight, on the land for four, five, and six kreuzers—yet good wine. A pound of meat can well be had in town for two kreuzes. A small loaf of bread for a white groschen—twelve pence—outside for sixpence. It is so large and white that one could hardly believe it. If the Danube were wider, it would be easier to import. As far as other eatables are concerned, everything costs a pretty penny. Oats a measure, eight to nine florins; corn a measure, fifteen to sixteen. The shock of straw costs six florins, the cord of wood eighteen. Of such matters there is no lack in anything. Candles are only to be bought the pound for five kreuzers and this with sore difficulty. A measure of wheat costs nineteen florins. Three quarts of oats cost nineteen kreuzers and a measure of corn fourteen florins.

186. Great Bankruptcies in Seville
        Antwerp
        15 October 1594
    This week there have arrived here two couriers, who were dispatched hither in great haste from Seville. They bring letters of the 20th day of September, in which there is written that a Spaniard, Pedro Perez Pardo, has failed for one hundred thousand, some aver one hundred and fifty thousand ducats. He is said to have drawn large sums on Martin Perez Barron and on Antonio Gallo of Salamanca in promissory notes. They have been informed that they are not to accept the bills of exchange which are expected daily by the Ordinary from Spain. Such insolvencies and difficulties are to be expected considering these ruinous days of war. These same letters contain news from Seville that the fleet from New Spain and Peru is expected there within eighteen or twenty days. It is said to carry seventeen millions of silver, and it is unknown how much gold, as well as thirteen hundred arobas of carmine and all kinds of other wares. One hundred and seventy ships there be in all. May the Lord permit that this fleet land in happiness and safety. This will be of much comfort to the traders of Spain and of other places, for the prospects are but poor and fraught with peril for the merchants.

156. Wondrous Tidings from Berlin and Leipzig
        Berlin
        23 December 1594
    Dear Lady Mother:
    I cannot hide from you that a few days ago the ten-year-old daughter of a God-fearing burgess had a vision by night in her sleeping chamber, which was suddenly filled with a great radiance. Shortly thereafter there appeared unto her the form of a beautiful youth, all clad in white, who held a sword in his hand. He quoth: “Listen, child of man, and fear not nor be horrified! I am a good angel sent by God to the intent that thou mayest preach before the high authorities and bid them know that the Lord will afflict the German lands as He hath done to those of His people the Jews, when they would not abandon their great conceit, their lust and their sins. For just as He is gracious, longsuffering and pitiful, so does He come in His wrath and anger to punish mankind.”
    This child had but the day before been for the first time to the Lord’s Table and although she did not speak much otherwise, she fearlessly repeated this angelical command before many people. Thus do the good angels preach that we must do penance and eternally offer praise to the gracious Lord for this consoling warning. On the other hand the bad angels preach most fearsomely and horribly in the Neumark. In a small town, Freiburg by name, evil spirits have possessed over one hundred and fifty pesons, to which the preachers and also our friends testify.
    Some few days ago a bad angel was also in Spandau, hardly two miles from here. There he made seven persons to be possessed, out of whom spoke the evil enemy. Many God-fearing people have heard this.
    When the eclipse of the moon took place on the night of the 19th to the 20th days of October at five of the morn, there were seen in the skies strange rays and likewise other signs. Through this it can well be assumed that God will punish us with various plagues, unless we do become converted in time and do real penance for our sins. May the Almighty provide for us in His fatherly fashion, not according to our deserts but according to His Mercy. Your beloved son, MAGISTER HERMANUS LIPHORPIUS, Rector.
            Leipzig, 25th day of December 1594
    What my brother wrote from Berlin and Spandau is, alack, but too true. The burgesses of Spandau have since then collected all high collars and burned them in the open market-place. In Berlin, likewise, it has been forbidden to wear high collars and the bows which women flaunt on their skirts. Two days ago, one of our servitors arrived from Silesia and he says that three weeks ago a mountain erupted close to a little town, Goldberg by name. Smoke issued therefrom and rose into the air; it turned upon the town, lifted the roof from two houses and a piece of the church, and then receded into the mountain. In the Striegau various people who were dead and buried have reappeared. They torment and frighten the people. It was decided to exhume one of them, cut off his head and bury him under the gallows, which was done, but it proved of no avail; he appeared as heretofore. It was then decided to exhume him once more and to burn him. After this he appeared no longer, and all the others did likewise vanish.

186-188. Attempted Murder of Henry IV
        Antwerp
        2 January 1595
    A letter from Paris of the 29th brings news that the King of Navarre all but perished in the palace of Madame de Lioncourt. For as he was returning the salute of one who had made obeisance to him, a youth between seventeen and eighteen years of age essayed to stick a knife into his throat. But the thrust went too high and pierced the right cheek, whereby the King has lost two of his teeth. The handle of the knife remained cleft between the teeth. How this is going to develop we shall know by the following letters.

189-190. Copy of the Judgment and Sentence passed by the Parliament in Paris upon Jean
Paris
unknown
            Chatel, a scholar who studied in the College of Jesuits, on account of the horrible murder which he dared to attempt against the King’s Person. Also the sentence passed upon the Jesuits, who have been banished from the Kingdom of France as Corrupters of Youth, Destroyers of the Peace and Enemies of the King and State.
    The Parliament has examined the criminal suit, which was begun by the Provost of the Royal House and thereafter was continued at the request of the Royal Procurator-General against Jean Chatel, who has studied in the College of Jesuits at Clermont and now lies in jail. Parliament has given hearing to the confession of Jean Chatel and of the Priest of the Society of Jesu, Jean Guerette, former tutor of Chatel, as well as that of Pierre Chatel and Dionysia Hasdrat, his parents, and to the charge of the Royal Procurator-General and has found: Jean Chatel has been recognized guilty of the crime against the divine and temporal Majesty and is condemned as follows: He must make public penance before the doors of the church in Paris, naked in a shirt, lie on his knees, and hold in his right hand a burning candle, two pounds in weight. He must say and confess that he planned the inhuman and horrible murder against the King, in most malicious and treacherous fashion, and did wound him in the face with a knife. He most likewise confess that during his trial, he did say, according to false and cursed instructions which he had received, that it was permissible to kill kings, and that Henry IV did not belong to the Church as long as he had not received confirmation thereof from the Pope. He must manifest remorse and sorrow and crave forgiveness from God and the King. When this shall have taken place he will be conducted to the Place de la Grève in the cart of infamy, and there be riven with tongs in the arms and the legs. His right hand will hold the knife with which he was desirous of committing the murder, and this will be lopped off. Then he will be rent asunder by four horses, his members and his body shall be thrown into the fire and his ashes strewn to the winds.
    Moreover, Parliament has declared that all his estate is to be confiscated and surrendered to the King. Parliament likewise forbids any one, of whatsoever condition he be, by fear of punishment for lese-majesty, to repeat publicly or privately the offensive and rebellious words of Jean Chatel, which are not according to the word of God and have been condemned through the holy decrees as heretical and accursed. It further recognizes that the priests and alumni of the College of Clermont, and all others who call themselves followers of the Society of Jesu, destroyers of the peace and enemies of the King and of the State, have, within three days after the promulgation of this judgment, to leave the city of Paris and all other towns and places wherever they may have their colleges, and within fourteen days to leave the kingdom. Should they still be found within the confines of the kingdom after this time has elapsed they shall be punished for the crime of lese-majesty, their movable and immovable property to be employed for works of charity and distributed according to the findings of Parliament. Moreover it is forbidden to all subjects of the King to send students to other Jesuit colleges outside the kingdom. Parliament recognizes further that the present decree is to be executed by all the courts and prefects of this district. It also orders all the prefects and governors to carry out the execution within a fixed period. The representatives of the Procurator-General are to keep the matter under their control and to report within a month to Parliament, on fear of losing their office, as to their success.

191. A Russian Embassy in Prague
        Prague
        18 August 1595
            background: Extract from the letter of a good friend.
    The Muscovite Embassy arrived here last Wednesday. They were received most splendidly and fittingly and escorted with four hundred horses. This Muscovite Embassy came ordinarily dressed and after the fashion of gipsies, since it was raining, and it would have been a sad pity had they been attired in sumptuous raiment. They have not yet had audience from His Majesty and therefore receive no one. They have brought hither some seventy coaches laden with delectable presents. They are kept free of expense and most lavishly entertained.

191. The Pope’s Pardon for Henry IV
        Rome
        5 September 1595
    Last Sunday morning at 8 o’clock the Pope caused himself to be carried in pontifical vestments to the square in front of the church of St. Peter. Nearly all the Cardinals present and a great number of prelates and gentlemen followed him thither. When he had taken his place with the Cardinals, there soon appeared the proxies of the King of Navarre, Messieurs Duperron and d’Ossat. They prostrated themselves before the Pope, kissed his feet and tendered to him their letters of introduction, in which the absolution which had oft been craved before, was submissively craved once again. The Pope showed himself favourably inclined to this petition, but he first commanded that a document be read out to the said proxies, in which it was declared that he was right willing to absolve the King, but that after receiving absolution the King was to say his rosary daily, attend Mass and conform to other spiritual exercises. Thereupon the aforesaid proxies first foreswore all heresies in the name of His Majesty, and publicly professed themselves to be of the Roman Faith. They likewise promised to carry through the conventions which had been agreed upon, and accepted the penance imposed on them.
    Thereupon the two Psalms Miserere and De Profundis were sung and the Pope gave the absolution and added that he had permitted the King ingress to the Church Militanf, and was willing to allow him likewise to be received into the Church Triumphant, after had shown himself proficient in the spiritual exercises that were pleasing to God. Then the Cardinal Sancta Severina conducted the proxies to the church of St. Peter, which had been closed hitherto, and there they knelt before the high altar, took their oath and made their prayer and their act of thanksgiving. They likewise swore that His Majesty would himself execute all that he had been bidden to do before an apostolic Legate. They then took leave of the Cardinal, betook themselves to the church of St. Luigi and heard Mass there. Afterwards they gave a stately banquet in their quarters to the gentlemen who had accompanied them. On this and the following days a cannon was fired on the Castello degli Angeli and various other joyful entertainments were likewise arranged.

192-193. The Russian Embassy in Prague
        Prague
        9 September 1595
    On the last day of August at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, the Grand-Ducal Embassy arrived here with fifty coaches. On each one there were chests covered with red leather, which were delivered and placed in the great hall. On the 1st and 2nd days of September the presents were taken out from the chests. When this was done His Imperial Majesty gave the members of the Embassy a banquet. At this they partook so freely of brandy and heavy Hungarian wines that they had partly to be carried home. The presents consist of one thousand sables, which, according to what people are telling us, are each worth forty thalers, further, five hundred and nineteen martens, and one thousand black fox, three thousand beaver, three thousand doeskins, and one thousand wolf furs. These wares were covered with seventy-four elk skins. It is also said that an offering from the Grand Duke is on the way, consisting of wax and flax, to which the present gifts cannot be compared! May God grant this!
    On the 3rd of this month there was held a banquet, to which His Majesty had commanded the attendance of his musicians and many distinguished gentlemen. All these were made to drink the health of the Grand Duke in brandy, which was greatly distasteful to them, especially to Rosenberg, who had never yet tasted it.

193-194. Peasants’ War in Upper Austria
        Vienna
        13 November 1596
    With regard to the Peasants’ War in Linz the tale goes round that the soldiery has again been skirmishing with the peasants near Freistadt. Six hundred men on both sides are said to have fallen, but victory remained with the peasants, who pursued the lansquenets as far as Freistadt. The Upper Austrian province is reported to have craved help from us in foot and horse. Two couriers arrived yesterday bringing with them a script according to which, if no help is sent, the nobles of Upper Austria will be in the utmost peril. For this reason Herr von Königsegg will be dispatched thither to-morrow with a troop of horsemen. Herr von Starhemberg is said to have lost three hundred riders in this affray.
    There be posted up everywhere notices for the levying of troops, for the peasants are waxing ever stronger. They are said to be encamped not far from here, forty thousand strong, near the Danube. One cannot wholly blame them, for they are sorely pressed with the new taxes which they cannot afford to pay. They have most stately and experienced leaders who keep strict discipline, so that much might be learned by us from them. Since all the towns in the country must needs send troops, those of Wels were but a short time ago attacked by the peasants and soundly trounced, but not killed. Only their armour and weapons were taken from them, and they were sent back. If this war were to continue the country would be ruined and fall into decay. May God prevent this upheaval!

194. English Pirates
        Rome
        8 April 1596
    Letters from the Spanish Court, dated the 8th day of March, report the arrival in Seville of three galleons laden with two million gold pieces and five hundred casks of crimson lake, which, the year before, remained behind in Porto Rico on their way from India. In Porto Rico five Spanish ships have run against two English vessels and captured one of these. When informed by the sailors that Drake with the rest of his fleet was not far away, two of the five Spanish ships again returned to Porto Rico. The other three were overtaken by Drake and burnt, whereupon he made bold to land near that spot. The inhabitants, however, put up resistance and killed about four hundred of his men, the famous French buccaneer, Zacaria, being among the number. Drake thereupon sailed for the Indies.

194. A Miracle in Jerusalem
        Venice
        10 April 1596
    A barefooted friar, who has just arrived here from Jerusalem, brings tidings that in the Holy City there has been discovered a hidden chapel without doors or windows, in which can be heard a wondrous harmony of angelic voices celebrating the Majesty of God. No one, however, dares touch this chapel or approach it.

194-195. A Meteor in Rome
        Rome
        27 April 1596
    On the evening of St. Mark’s Day there arose here a terrible storm which lasted for more than half an hour, and drove fear and trembling unto many. On the same evening a ball of fire appeared near the “Angels’ Bridge,” and floated eastward across the sky. It came with such an uproar that the earth began to quake. Then it disappeared forthwith.

195. Index Librorum Prohibitorum
        Rome
        1 June 1596
    Whereas many new heretical books are being printed, the titles of these have been collected in an Index and their publication has been definitely prohibited.

195. Panic at a Bull Fight
        Madrid
        6 July 1596
    A few days ago, the inhabitants of Toledo, according to their custom, have held a bull fight before His Majesty. A great multitude having collected, some evil young rogues suddenly set up the cry: “The houses are falling!”  Thereupon such panic arose among the people that they rushed out of them and betook themselves to the tablados or tribunes. This caused one of these to collapse, and several persons were hurt. The others fled without caps, hats or coats—the women without capes or slippers, only in scanty attire. In the meantime, some graceless ruffians arrived and carried off all they could lay hands on, especially plate and golden trinkets. This turmoil lasted for over an hour.

195. A Bad Omen
        Rome
        6 July 1596
    During these last days at about 2 o’clock in the morning a comet, with tail pointing towards the east, has appeared in the west. Rumour has it that this generally means the death of a great personage.

196-197. The Funeral of His Most Serene Highness Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria and Tyrol
        Innsbruck
        20 July 1596
    First of all there stepped forth various craftsmen and their guilds from the local Presbytery. In front of them strode the custodian of the Hospital, holding a candle protected by a shade. Then came one hundred patriarchs in black coats and smocks, each carrying a burning candle in his hand. Then came the venerable Council of Hall in mourning garb, with burning candles. Then came the honourable and wise Council from the princely town of Innsbruck, likewise with burning lights. Then followed the Town Clerk of Freiburg and the Town Clerk of Enzenstein. Then all the officials and the regimental and civilian scribes, together with the valets of His Most Serene Highness, the regimental secretaries and the gentlemen of the Capuchin Order, twelve of whom bore aloft a silver cross. They were followed by the Franciscans, the barefooted friars and the monks from Wilten. Then came the whole of the clergy with several of their vicars, twenty-four in all. Then the choristers and musicians of His Most Serene Highness, the Court Chaplain, the Court Preacher Antonius and the Father Almoner. Then nine prelates, the Suffragan Bishop of Brixen, the doctors and secretaries, the nobility, the military and financial Councillors, the Provincial Diet and the dapifers and grooms of the chamber of His Serene Highness, also the army kettledrums, swathed in black cloth. Then the flags—a light blue flag with the Hapsburg escutcheon and a stately black charger caparisoned in black with the coat of arms of Tyrol hanging on both sides. Then a yellow flag with the coat of arms of Tyrol; a beautiful red flag with the coat of arms of Württemberg and Swabia; a green taffeta flag with the coat of arms of Carniola; a fig-brown flag with the coat of arms of Styria; a double-width white taffeta flag with the coat of arms of Burgundy; a blue flag with the coat of arms of Austria; and an entirely golden flag with the full coat of arms of His Highness of blessed memory. Then there was led past a magnificent horse with silver-gilt trappings and a red velvet saddle. It was decked in front and behind with white feathers. Then came Herr Siegmund von Welsberg carrying a long black flag which trailed on the ground; then Herr Christoph von Welsberg bearing on a black velvet cushion the Golden Fleece. Herr von Kolowrat as a former Master of the Horse carried the gilt helmet with gorgeous peacock feathers. Then two gentlemen carried a large shield with different coats of arms embossed thereon; next was borne a beautiful gilt sword, and the Count of Hohenembs came next, carrying a silver-gilt sceptre. The Count of Nogarol bore the hat of the Archduke. Then came the ducal bier. It weighed about seven hundredweight, and twenty-eight noblemen supported it with much strain. Then followed His Eminence the Cardinal, the son of His Highness, the Archduke Mathias and the Ambassadors to His Highness. The Count of Lodron and Herr von Vrintz led the Archduchess, then came the young Archduchesses, their governess and the tiring-women. Then followed the Commander of the Life Guards, and the bodyguards of the Archduke Ferdinand. The procession lasted five hours and passed through the town, the suburbs, the fortifications and then into the new burial-ground.

197-198. The Baptism of Jews in Rome
        Rome
        5 August 1596
    These days a rich and prominent Jew, bent on some business with a monk in the Chiesa Nuova betook himself thither. This Father converted him in such wise to the Christian Faith, that the Jew at once sent for his wife, and questioned her, if she, likewise, would be received unto the Church. She declared that she was willing to do so, and the Jew has since remained with the aforementioned monk. His wife was confided to the care of a devout woman. The possessions of the Jew were confiscated at once by the order of the Law.

198-199. Murder Will Out
        Jena in Saxony
        12 September 1596
    In the electoral town of Dresden it occurred latterly that a tanner was called away from his house. During this time the executioner, who held commerce with him in skins, came into his house, and finding that the tanner was absent he assaulted his wife, violated her and cut off her head. When the tanner returned he knocked for a long time and as no one opened unto him, sought assistance from his neighbours. When, however, the dead woman was discovered they accused the husband and put him into prison. There he was cruelly tortured by the executioner, so that in his great agony he confessed to the murder. Thereupon he was condemned to die on the rack. As he was led forth undeservedly to execution and the executioner had already broken one of his legs and was going to break the other, the wheel caught the executioner by the neck so that he was unable to get away. As he was pinned in this position he confessed the deed and was taken into custody. He was confronted with the injured man. The tanner will be healed and great honour has been shown to him. The executioner still lies in prison. God allows nothing to remain concealed, and all things, whether great or small, always come to the light of day.
    Fourteen days ago, there happened at Halberstadt, eighteen miles away, a deplorable affair. A parson was called unto a woman in childbed to baptize her new-born infant, but when he was about to return to his home such a thunderstorm arose that he ran back to the woman’s house and remained there for two hours. In the meantime the accouchée and others with her fell asleep. Thereupon the parson seized the child and ran away with it. Shortly after the people awake and look round for the child. The father runs to the parson’s house and goes into it. As he enters the room he sees the parson standing before the table and the child cut in four parts in a cauldron. Thereupon he caused the parson to be taken prisoner. The latter confessed that had he had another quarter of an hour’s grace, neither corn nor wine nor the grass in the field would have remained, and everything on the ground would have perished. This, however, the good Lord prevented in His mercy and for that we must be grateful to Him.

199. Spanish Financial Policy
        Lyons
        19 September 1596
    King Philip of Spain intends to confiscate and keep for his own use and purpose the share of gold and silver belonging to different persons, which the fleet has just brought home. This comes to nearly ten millions, as shown below, and its confiscation will be detrimental to many.
    A record of what is due to each individual from the incoming fleet, which will be kept back by the Kind for his own profit:

200-202. The Sultan goes to War
unknown
unknown
            background: Tidings which were brought to Gran by the retainers of Herr von Kreckwitz.
    When the demise of Herr von Kreckwitz, the Ambassador to Turkey and of His Roman Imperial Majesty occurred, it was at first decided to put his retainers to death; but as they had tendered long and faithful service they were set at liberty in the following manner:
    On the 20th of June the Turkish Emperor set out from Constantinople with his vast army. On the 7th day of July the twenty-two retainers of Herr von Kreckwitz were taken from the Black Tower and delivered to the English Ambassador, Edward Burton, at Galatta. On the 13th day we arrived from Constantinople at Dothsichugh and thus on the 27th day at Philippopoli, an old and famous town.
    On the 1st of August we came to Sophia, on the 7th to Nish and on the 13th to Greek-Weissenburg. There we came upon the Emperor in all his might. He has a camp so large that it cannot be surveyed. On the 14th the Ambassador went to the Vesir-Pasha and kissed his feet, whereupon he released us, but bade us not to be as ungrateful as had been the Transylvanians. He has ordered us to convey to our Emperor tidings of the power of this All-Mightiest Emperor, which we had witnessed. On the 18th there were brought in thirty captured Hungarians, of whom two were killed and left lying on the square, for any one to see.
    On the 20th the Turkish Emperor moved his camp from Greek-Weissenburg.
    On the 14th the Emperor was publicly seen on a white stallion in a satin coat. On his turban he wore a black aigrette; on the 30th the Ambassador and his retinue having gorgeously attired themselves, waited on the Emperor early and paid their respects to him.
    That night we lay in Grosswardein, a Turkish fortress. On the 1st of September we saw the whole army on a green plain. That day the Emperor rode a brown horse. He ordered jugglers to perform in his presence, after which he entered a green coach and was driven thence. From the 6th to the 9th of September we rested quietly at Szegedin, a trade centre with a castle.
    On that day, the first tidings reached the Grand Turk that the Christians had taken Hatván by storm. Thereupon he quoth: “Let them take it now. When I come there I will recapture it all!”  We were in great danger of being massacred. Thereafter a captured Christian was brought in from Szolnok, who related how Hatván was seized and how over fifty thousand men had beleaguered it.
    On the 10th of September as we were marching off we beheld, on all sides, many burning villages, which the Tartars had set alight. On the 12th the Emperor pitched his camp at Szolnok. On the 15th he ordered it to be proclaimed that all Christian children should be registered, for he wanted to turn them into Janissaries, as he was in need of these. On two days he made a holiday for all his soldiery and a thousand aspri were given to each man.
    On the 17th we were sent away from the camp near Szolnok and on the 20th we reached Buda.
    On the 21st the interpreter betook himself to the Pasha of Ofen with the Emperor’s orders, whereupon he released our companions and had them brought to us.
    On the 23rd we went by boat to Ofen and in the evening we reached Waizen. As we sailed in our ship below the fortress the garrison took us for Turks and shot at us with a gun. The cannon ball fell half a fathom’s length from us into the water. Then we cried out and made signs to them.
    On the 25th we reached Gran.
    The Turkish Emperor Mehemed must be about thirty years old. His camp is estimated at five hundred thousand, but Christians and Turks who are well versed in matters of war assert that among them he has but a hundred thousand good warriors at the most. The rest are camel and donkey drivers and riff-raff.
    The chief Vizier, Ibrahim Pasha, is a Croat, Sokolli an alien.
    The Pasha of Aleppo was taken a prisoner at Erlau where he was beheaded.
    Hassan Pasha, Scharrar Mehemed Pasha and Mehemed Pasha are eunuchs.
    What other Pashas and Beglerbeghs there are from Anotolia—and there are many—is unknown to us.

202. The Peasant War in Upper Austria
        Linz
        1 December 1596
    Our peasants behave as if possessed by the devil. They collect in all four quarters and it is believed that the day before yesterday there were eighteen thousand of them in Kremsmünster. They did no violence, for food and drink were proffered to them at their first demand. Of this, however, they refused to partake. They seem bewitched, for as soon as the word is given, even in this cold, they leave their wives and children, hasten from their houses and farms, yet attacking neither towns, castles, nor even villages. They tell the populace, whom they drag along with them, that for all they care, horses, oxen and cows, even the women may perish, and they pawn their cattle with the inn-keepers and drink away their gold.
    To-morrow we expect a great number of them, in spite of the fact that the Proclamation which will be read to them has already arrived from Prague. I learn that by this Proclamation His Majesty grants them his pardon, though by their rebellion they have forfeited all their possessions, as well as their lives. Before next Tuesday His Serene Highness Archduke Mathias should come to Linz, for his retinue is already arriving hourly.

202-204. Presentation of the Order of the Garter to Henry IV
        Venice
        6 December 1596
    We are informed from Rouen of the ceremonies which took place when the King of France was at Vespers presented with the Order of the Garter in the archiepiscopal church near the royal palace. His Majesty was attired all in white in a most magnificent and exquisite manner, and wore a velvet hat with white feathers. He sat under a canopy on a chair on which lay a blue velvet cushion. On the left side of the chancel there was another canopy of gold cloth. Underneath it stood four chairs, and above these hung the coats of arms of England, Scotland, Denmark and of the States of Holland and Zeeland. A little lower down, on a red chair, sat the English Ambassador, near whom stood a herald in a garment of red and blue velvet, with the English coat of arms on his breast. The herald held a crimson-coloured cushion on which lay the Order of the Garter. When Vespers were over the King betook himself to the altar, where the Bishop of Auvergne sat robed in his pontifical vestments. On his right were two cardinals in red robes, to his left the Papal Nuncio and the Ambassadors of Scotland and Venice and the Duc de Joyeuse. Then the King stood up and was arrayed in a brown cassock and a low-necked velvet coat, trimmed with ermine. Thereupon the English Ambassador caused his instructions to be read out publicly by M. de Villeroy in a resounding voice and invested His Majesty with ring and chain, fastening round his right leg the Garter, beautifully embroidered with gold and pearls. Thereupon one hundred noblemen, many dukes, counts and other officers of the Crown who were decorated with the Order of the Holy Ghost, accompanied the King from the church with the trumpeter walking in front of them. The King’s shield and helmet were likewise carried before him.
    After His Majesty came the two cardinals and the English Ambassador. They accompanied the King to his palace. Thereupon six heralds clad in white proclaimed in all the squares: “Now there reigneth good and perfect peace between the almighty King Henry, Fourth of the Name, by the Grace of God King of France and Navarre and the almighty Elizabeth, Queen of England and Ireland. Both sovereigns bind themselves to the defence of their realms and thrones and promise each other everlasting protection and assistance. All those who would cause these Powers detriment or offence are threatened by them with war and destruction of their lands and subjects." Thereupon each went to his own home and in the palace where was held a princely banquet, there appeared many noblemen in masks and disguises.

204. Spanish Financial Policy
        Venice
        13 December 1596
    The King of Spain has sternly commanded that no gold or silver should be exported from the kingdom, or used for the purposes of trade. He has ascertained that this gold is recoined into the currency of foreign princes and that great profit is derived therefrom. It is also rumoured that a large sum of money for all sorts of merchandise has been dispatched to the Levant, where it has flown into the coffers of the Turkish Emperor. It seems that His Majesty is resolved to fit out a fleet out of the four or five millions of gold which are to be paid out yearly to the merchants as interest. Through this his bills of exchange will circulate slowly, causing much bankruptcy for money is very dear among the merchants.

204-205. Spanish Financial Policy
        Rome
        25 January 1597
    We hear through the last letters from Spain that the King has asked Portuguese merchants for a loan of four millions for Flanders. They were willing to gratify His majesty’s wishes but under the four following conditions:
    1. That His Majesty should pay the sums which he owes them.
    2. That they should also retain a third of their claim out of the above-mentioned loan.
    3. That they should be at liberty to trade in the Indies.
    4. That His Majesty should accept as payment various kinds of coins of the 
        Spanish realm. This, however, displeases His Majesty much, as he resents
        this demand as being extortinate.
            Venice, 31 January 1597
    This last letter from Spain corroborated the fact that after repeated examination of the merchants’ accounts, it will be proved that His Majesty owes them nothing, but that it is they who are debtors of His Majesty on account of the large sums which they have taken as interest during the last twenty years. This is to be recorded in print, that all may realize that His Majesty is not one to withhold the rightful property of others. In spite of this the Signori Ambrogio Spinola, Biccomelio and Malvenda daily plead at Court for reduction of payment, which might easily be granted, if they but paid the Cardinal of Austria two millions of gold at the end of march and the same amount with 6 per cent. in May. Letters from Genoa of the 15th day of December report that on account of the above-mentioned affair the Signori Francesco Marino and Francesco Serra have gone to Flanders to settle about a loan of three millions with that Court.

205. Birth of a Monstrosity at Vienna
        Vienna
        15 March 1597
    In the New Market here a poor lansquenet’s wife gave birth to a child who had a head on his back just like an Indian cock, and legs which were turned the wrong way at the knees so that it hit itself in the belly when it wished to bend them. It soon died, but not before being baptized.

205-206. Philip II Borrows Again 
        Rome
        29 March 1597
    It is written from Madrid on the 4th day of the month that the King has published a decree whereby no silver coins are to be exported from the realm. He has also ordered that the reals, which before were worth thirty maravedi, are henceforward to be changed for forty maravedi. The King has also signed with his own hand the deed of the loan of Herr Fugger, and confirmed it by a decree. But for the other merchants the situation is still unfavourable.

207-208. The Peasants’ War in Lower Austria
        Vienna
        15 April 1597
    The rebellious peasants have not as yet been pacified, and lie a few thousand strong near Melk. But many of them are being killed, hanged and made prisoners by the cavalry. Only yesterday more than twenty of them were brought into the Government House, amongst whom there were many ringleaders, also their commander, together with his lieutenant. The horsemen take everything the possess away from them, sending away daily whole shiploads of bed linen, bacon, dripping, all sorts of household goods and much money, and thus they collect great riches, as the peasants here are very wealthy. Last Good Friday there came here a ship laden with such like things, among which were two big casks of forty buckets each of wine, besides a chest and a few coffers filled with money. The journeymen seized them, tapped the casks and allowed all the wine to flow out. They broke open the chest and robbed it. The two small coffers, which no one could carry by himself, were taken away in a skiff by the fishermen, who shared their contents. On the following Wednesday such a ship again arrived and the people wished to treat it in the same manner. The horsemen who accompanied this vessel sent warning to the judge, who thereupon betook himself with his servants and other varlets to the river. They caught the thieves, dragged them off to prison and on the next day hanged four of them; although one of these had but taken a pailful of wine and the other two hens from the ship, one of which fell into the water. Of the fishermen who had stolen the small coffers with the money, twenty-five were caught. Of these some were let free, but they have to pay a fine of five thousand florins. What it is intended to do with the others time will show. If they are not punished people’s possessions will no longer be safe. Since the vintagers of Mödling, Petersdorf, Baden, Inzersdorf, Gumpoldskirchen and other places have refused to work any longer for their old wages, they have become rebellious. They collected about two thousand strong, and the nobility and all landowners were commanded to gather with their horses in as great numbers as was possible to them. Thus were raised about three hundred horses and a troop of infantry. So they broke up camp last Friday and marched on Mödling, Baden and Pfaffstätten. There they fell upon the rebellious vintagers before daybreak and immediately hanged a drummer and six ringleaders. When the rest saw that they were outnumbered they at once consented to parley and themselves delivered their ringleaders, of whom more than fifty were brought in by the horsemen, and, as a punishment, forced to work in the town moat.

208-209. A Religious Decree which was printed in Vienna and carried into the house of each burgess and communicated to him in the months of May and June 1597
        unknown
        1597
    The Mayor and Corporation of the city of Vienna by the gracious and earnest enactment of His Most Serene Highness, the Archduke Mathias of Austria, our most noble master, remind all burgesses, inhabitants and domestic servants, but first and foremost the drivers of vehicles in and outside the town, that they must altogether refrain from walking, riding, or driving on Sundays, holidays and other days to Enzersdorf, Vösendorf, Rodaum and other such like places to hear the sectarian, seductive preachers; also from being united there in matrimony, or having their children baptized by them, as many a time already this has been forbidden under threat of chastisement to body or loss of property, and confiscation of the carriage and the horse. This is to be intimated herewith and declared, in order that it should be complied with, as an ultimate warning, under penalty of severe and implacable punishment, so that none should excuse himself with ignorance thereof.

209. A Rain of Blood in Vienna
        Vienna
        18 July 1597
    At noon to-day, in a few places in front of the Schottentor, it rained blood. This was witnessed by many people, and many basketfuls of stones covered with blood were carried into the town.
        Vienna, undated
    An order to the mayor of this our town—Paulus Steyrer—to be delivered on the 19th day of July 1597.
    It is made known to the Mayor of this town, Paulus Steyrer, by the Government of Lower Austria, that, according to trustworthy reports, yesterday in front of the Schottentor in Siechenals, also at Hernals, Döbling, Sievering and near these places there fell a rain of blood. The stones which were sprinkled by it are said to be in existence. In order, however, to have a precise report thereon, the command goes forth from the Government that the Mayor should at once set an inquiry afoot as to the way in which this took place and that he should send information to the Government about the same before noon.
        Vienna, 19 July 1597
    The faithful report of Paulus Steyrer, Mayor of this town, in obedience to the above Decree. The enclosed Decree I have received with due reverence, and in order to obtain special information regarding this matter, I betook myself in my own person, accompanied by a burgess of the Outer Council, Georg Hesch by name, to certain villages, namely Hernals, Währing and Unter-Döbling. In Döbling I found out from the judge that a butcher in Nussdorf had last Friday bought on the oxen market three oxen. These he ordered his servant to drive home. As, however, one of the oxen was very lazy and hard to drive, the butcher’s man cut his tail with a knife and made him bleed. Thus the blood flowed into the hairs of the tail, and the ox splashed it about, whisking his tail this way and that, thus sprinkling the whole road. Wherever then the blood fell upon a stone there it remained. Thereupon I went with the above-named Hesch to Nussdorf, where I found both the ox and the butcher’s house; I have also, with my own eyes, seen the ox sprinkling the blood. Except for this no blood fell on any one’s body or clothing, and also no blood was found in the foliage of the trees or in the vineyards. So much have I to report obediently to Your Honour.
        Vienna, 22 July 1597
    It is still impossible to find the right explanation for the rain of blood. The Mayor reports of a wounded ox, others tell otherwise, among them Herr Streinz, keeper of the door of His Serene Highness, and a ducal halberdier. These report that the town is full of stones covered with blood, but that the drops of blood are as small as a raindrop or as large as lentils. As Herr Streinz has it, both may be right. We shall, however, investigate still further.

209. An Indian Rising in Peru
        Venice
        15 August 1597
    It is rumoured that five hundred Spaniards and fifteen thousand Indians have risen in Peru against Don Pedro de Valasco on account of religious dissensions. This is bad news not only for Spain but also for the merchants, as gold and silver arrives from Peru, conveyed hither by the fleet, and this will now be prevented by this rising.

210-211. Report on the disturbances between the Bohemians and the Walloons in the Neustadt near Prague
District of Neustadt
        8 September 1597
    Last Wednesday, the 3 this month, eight hundred Walloon horsemen arrived here. They are very brave men, but they did not wish to leave without money, therefore on the 5th they were given a month’s pay. Thereupon, on the next day they bestrode their horses and were bout to depart when, about 6 o’clock, there arose great discord between the Walloons and the Bohemian rabble here, on account of paltry and worthless reasons. At first it began with a few Walloons, because others had been back and forth in the town on their own business, and had been unable to return quickly to their quarters and their horses. The Bohemians, however, as though possessed, flocked together a few thousand strong, with firearms, iron tools, flails and other murderous weapons. Moreover, rendering the disturbance and the concourse of the common rabble still greater and more dangerous, the alarm was raised from the Mansion House and likewise in all other points of the town and the cry arose: “Kill the dogs!”  Thereupon they quickly overpowered the few Walloons, about fifty in number, who had collected in a hurry. Of these, who wished to return homeward and were innocent, twenty were shot, wounded and killed. Amongst the number were some eminent members of the nobility, some cornets and commandants and two pregnant women, one of whom bore boy twins. Also some innocent boys who were killed and thrown out of the window. But the insane Bohemians did not stop thereat, for not only did they strip the killed Walloons to their shirts—worse than any Turks would have done—but they hacked the naked corpses to such an extent that they were hardly to be recognized, and left them lying on the street. Moreover, they sole their horses, utensils and weapons, their clothes, and plundered all that was to be found in their quarters. Their Captain reported to the Castle that a hundred horses were missing, but of the Bohemians not more than two were killed. For whereas the Bohemians were shouting that all the German dogs should be killed, it is easily understood that a general riot must needs follow. On account of this His Imperial majesty sent for the captains at ten at night and ordered that this rebellion should be suppressed. The bodies of the dead were taken out of the houses and the streets. His Majesty and his following and, above all, the foreigners are deeply aggrieved. On the next day, the Walloons took themselves off. Those, however, who were robbed and the wounded are still here, and many corpses are believed to lie still hidden in secret places, cellars, ice-pits and such like. It is rumoured that fifty in all were done to death. May God guard us against such evil in future!

211. The Execution of the Rebellious Peasants in Vienna
        Vienna
        25 October 1597
    I can report nothing new except that yesterday the chief ringleaders of the rebellious peasants, the cooper and the tailor, together with two others, a provost and a commander, were executed in this town in the place called Hof, on a scaffold. The cooper was quartered alive, and the two others were beheaded. The tailor and these two died in pious, Christian and Catholic fashion, confessing their sins before death and partaking of Holy Communion. The cooper died unrepentant and in his Lutheran heresy. This is a fearsome example, and all rebels should take warning therefrom. Four more ringleaders have been made prisoners here. They will be taken to Waidhofen and one especially, Schremser by name, who was a colonel, will be quartered there, but the other three will be put to the sword.

212. Excommunication of Cesare d’Este.
        Rome
        27 December 1597
    In the Consistorium held here last Monday, in the presence of the Pope, the Bull of Excommunication against Don Cesare d’Este and his associates was read out in a clear voice by Cardinal Peretti, as Deacon, before the full assembly of the Holy College. After that the Pope fell on his knees, kissed the candle which he held between his hands and thereupon spoke the anathema against Don Cesare and his followers. Then he returned to his customary place.
    His Holiness wishes likewise to include in this excommunication all those who hinder the proclamation of the Bull and such as did not permit the transit of provisions for the papal troops. At the same time there goeth forth a decree, addressed to the Imperial and Royal Majesty, as well as to all the Christian princes, that no help whatsoever is to be vouchsafed to Don Cesare and his vassals. Whoever opposes this command also comes under the Bull of Excommunication, and preachers exhort the people to guard themselves against it. Twelve days’ grace has, however, been granted to Don Cesare.

212-214. The Expulsion of the Hanseatic Merchants from England
        Cologne
        12 February 1598
            background: Letters from Amsterdam confirm the expulsion of the German merchants from England. This will come as a blow to many and in especial to the hanseatic merchants who have had their business and their own houses in London.
THE ROYAL DECREE OF EXPULSION
    We, Elizabeth, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, send Our greetings to Our dearly loved and faithful Mayors and Justices of Our City of London. Under the title of a mandate, the Roman Emperor has lodged a complaint with all Electors, Bishops, Counts, the Diets and all citizens regarding different injuries, which it is supposed have been inflicted in Our Realm upon the United Hanseatic Towns. The Roman Emperor complains of prejudice caused to the Hanseatic towns by Our merchants, known as the Merchant Adventurers. His grievance is obviously a great injustice and opposed to all that is right and fitting. Nevertheless, not only is it forbidden to all our merchants to trade in the Roman Empire, but it is also commanded under threat of fines and punishment that they eschew that Empire and trade, neither openly nor secretly, in any towns or harbours therein. They are threatened with imprisonment and confiscation of goods, and various other sentences of extreme rigour are pronounced against Our subjects. We have already dispatched a letter to the Roman Emperor, as well as to the Electors and other Princes, in order that they should learn Our answer to the attacks of the Hanseatic towns. We have asked in the epistle that this order should not be cancelled, but merely postponed. Inasmuch as we are doubtful whether this will be granted, we have, in the meantime, found it proper to command all citizens of the Hanseatic Towns and the Roman Empire to cease trading. This particularly concerns those who inhabit the “Stalhof,” and Our City of London. We have threatened them in like manner with the same punishments as contained in the Imperial Decree. In order to carry out this Our decree, We command you, the Mayors and Justices of our above-named City of London, to betake yourselves at once to the house which is called Stalhof.
    Order the chiefs residing in that house into your presence, and announce to them this Our decree. You will command them to leave Our kingdom on the 28 g this month on the same day as Our merchants have to leave the Roman Empire. You are further ordered to inform all citizens of the Hanseatic towns of the Roman Empire wheresoever they may be, that they must leave the country on the same day. You will arrange the attendance of their Mayor and their Justice and that of two officers from our Licensing House, in order to take possession of the Stalhof on the 28th day of January. This will be in force till we learn whether there is no way and means to approach the Roman Emperor, and obtain for Our subjects permission to right of trade in the Roman Empire. In corroboration of Our will, we have published this Our letter in Our High Council of Whitehall on the 13th day of January in the fortieth year of Our reign.
    Ad Notam: From this order are excluded those Hanseatic towns situated in the Kingdom of Poland, which have had nothing to do with the above-mentioned Imperial indictment.

214. A Present for the Mistress of Henry IV
        Venice
        8 May 1598
    The Duchess of Mercurio has presented Madame Gabrielle d’Estrées, the favourite of the King of France, with beauteous pleasure grounds and a park with animals in Brittany, worth more than sixty thousand crowns.

214. The Death of Philip II
        Madrid
        13 September 1598
    After our King had lain ill for some time, he died here in the monastery of the Escurial on the 12th of the month at 5 o’clock in the morning. May God have mercy on His Majesty. Immediately thereafter a courier was dispatched to the Imperial Court. His Majesty had been three weeks in his bed and could not be moved on account of large ulcers which had broken out. He was also forced to lie prone always.

215. A Tender-Hearted Son
        Rome
        5 October 1598
    In letters from Messina dated the 24th day of September we have it that Ciccala has sent a Christian slave with a letter to the Viceroy. In this he says that four years running he has gone into that sea with his Armada, because he feels a great desire to see his mother and take counsel with her. Permission to do this he was never able to obtain from the former Viceroy, wherefore he has done damage to the town of Reggio and other places in Calabria. If the Viceroy would but send his mother to him, he, in return, would refrain from attacking any ships, whether in this, or any other Spanish sea. He would also send back his mother in safety. Thereupon the Viceroy made answer in Spanish that he could not grant his request unless he, that is Ciccala, would send his son with several Turks as hostages. These the latter dispatched at once with two galleys to Messina. Then the Viceroy sent the mother and the brothers with several friends and accompanied by some well-known noblemen, on the galley to Ciccala, who showed great honour to all. After he had remained for four hours with his mother, and had presented her, as well as the people previously mentioned, with golden pieces and other gifts, he allowed them to depart in peace to Messina. He also sent the Viceroy several presents and conveyed to him a message that on the very next day he should set sail for Tripoli in order to quell the disturbances there.

215-216. The Will of Philip II
        Venice
        8 October 1598
    Letters from Spain confirm the death of the King in the seventy-first year of his life and the forty-first year of his reign. Before he died he is said to have ordered all his gentlemen to depart from him, that he might be alone with his son, the Prince. He rests in a coffin encased in lead. He has exhorted his son, after he should have succeeded his ancestor Charles V, of most blessed memory, and His Majesty, to grant due obedience to the Pope and the Apostolic See in all his kingdoms, to love peace above all things, and to lay hands on nothing but that which was his by rights. Also that he should practise justice in all his territories and keep perpetual peace with the King of France and other Christian princes, and particularly with the Republic of Venice. He also gave him a sealed letter, which His Majesty has written with his own hand and has ordered him not to open before His Majesty should have given up the ghost.

216. The Attempted Murder of Maurice of Nassau
        Antwerp
        15 October 1598
    It is confirmed that an attempt has been made to stab Maurice of Nassau with a long weapon which looked like a pointed dagger, the interior of which was full of holes and poison. The assassin, however, betrayed himself and confessed in prison that some years before he had been persuaded to do this by the Jesuits, who had sworn to pay him a large sum of money. They had already paid him in advance one hundred Flemish pounds, and the remainder he was to receive after he had committed the deed. Whether this will further the peace negotiations, time will show.

216-218. The War in Sweden
        Danzig
        18 October 1598
    I enclose the news which we have received from Sweden from His Royal Majesty of Poland. Duke Charles had petitioned through the Electors and the Ducal Ambassadors to be allowed to appear in person before His Majesty in order to justify his mode of government and to refute the calumnies of his adversaries; but safe conduct was not granted unto him. It was required that he should surrender at discretion, disband all his troops and await submissively the verdict of the King. This the Duke was unable to accept; he thanked the Ambassadors for their trouble and resorted to other means. On the 17th September he advanced with all his troops, twelve thousand infantry and one thousand five hundred cavalry, to within one and half a mile of the King’s camp and there pitched his own. He himself appeared about quarter of a mile from the King’s camp with six hundred men and sent a herald to the King with the request that he should be allowed to parley with four of the latter’s Counsellors. These the King sent to him and to them the Duke expounded his fruitless efforts to obtain a personal interview with the King, in which he could have justified himself. He begged the four gentlemen for their mediation. Though they answered him in a churlish manner, yet they carried his petition to the King, who, however, rejected it and once more reaffirmed the above-named grievous conditions. In the meantime a skirmish had arisen between the six hundred Swedes of Charles and the four hundred Hungarians, in which the Swedes were defeated. Through the personal intervention of the King and the Duke the fight was suspended. Thereupon the Duke again inquired for the conditions in order to settle the whole dispute. He was informed that he must make his submission, disband his troops, retreat and appear before the appointed Diet at Stockholm. In view of his danger the Duke accepted these conditions as he wished to display his goodwill and avoid further bloodshed; he also withdrew, but only in order to occupy a more favourable position before the Castle of Stangeborg, which he was able to bombard as well as the King’s camp. When the King’s army became aware of this the next morning, it lost heart. Thereupon Duke Charles rejected the old conditions and put forward new ones which were hardly more acceptable. New negotiations were begun, which the Duke prolonged on purpose because he was expecting his Armada from Finland, where it had scattered the royal troops. He also learned that the King’s fleet had been driven from its course to Stockholm by storm, and that it has lost part of its crew. He determined to strike at the King by land and by sea, as soon as his fleet had arrived. The King, however, retreated secretly by night, no one knows where, forsaking all his provisions. When the crews of the Royal Fleet, which was lying off Stockholm, went ashore the following morning, in order to receive their pay, they found the camp empty. As now, however, the news of the approach of Charles’s Armada began to spread, and as they had orders to take aboard the large stores of provisions and ammunition, they quickly weighed anchor. But only twenty-five of the sixty ships arrived in safety to the port of Danzig. Two were sent to the bottom, the flagship together with two others, which were overladen, ran ashore and their precious cargo was plundered by Charles’s ships. The others, about thirty in number, mostly Scotch and English, did not put up any sort of defence and remained quietly at anchor. Duke Charles sent them a message that it was known to him that they had but agreed to convoy the troops under compulsion, and that no harm would befall them or the goods aboard, did they but willingly surrender. This they did. Thus Duke Charles obtained considerable booty and a great victory. Nothing is known about the King’s fate. The King’s mistake is that he did not defeat the Duke and take him prisoner as some of his Counsellors had advised.

218-219. Philip’s Lack of Money
        Madrid
        20 November 1598
    The new King of Spain, with his cavaliers, on the 8th of this month held his entry in most magnificent fashion into San Hieronymo, not far from here, under a canopy which was carried by twenty men, and on this occasion there was a display of much gold and silver and precious stones. Now the King is preparing to sally forth to Barcelona with his sister and his mother. This is due to take place next December. But there is great penury. And whereas the fleet is expected in January with gold and silver, His Majesty had countenanced negotiation with the purveyors of the Court for a sum of four hundred thousand ducats to be paid out at different dates in the Netherlands.
    On the 7th day of November on account of the plague, which is spreading more and more, several streets in Lisbon have been barricaded and in the Palace all gates have been closed excepting one. Also in front of this palace a whole street has been walled up and so has a house in which there were many different articles of value; the people who lived in it were also driven out. But some daring youngsters assembled and carried everything away at night time. In Galicia as well death holds sway.

219. August Visitors to the House of Fugger in Augsburg
        Augsburg
        25 February 1599
    Last Saturday evening His Serene Highness the Arch-Duke Maximilian, together with the reigning Prince of Bavaria and about three hundred members of his retinue and a stately following of noble dames, arrived here and took a lodging in the house of Herr Marx Fugger. On the following Sunday and Monday there was held in the presence of His Serene Highness and his spouse, a most magnificent and splendid tourney and tilting at the ring, by the Herren Antonius and Christoph Fugger as Mantenatores and the other gentlemen as Aventuriers in exquistie ornaments and raiment. Curious processions were also witnessed. In particular a Bavarian peasant wedding at which the peasants were entertained with food and drink in the open wine market. Thereupon these peasants danced and sang, and feinted and skirmished with their daggers, all this, which was most pleasant to behold, contributing to the entertainment of His Serene Highness. On the Tuesday following the Magistrate of the town gave a sumptuous banquet in the Town Hall to His Serene Highness and to His Spouse and to other men and women of high rank; moreover, a wondrously beautiful ball, in the dancing hall above the wine market, which was ornamented most pleasingly with branches of fir and a black velvet dais and beautiful hangings. When the dance came to an end at seven at night, two little sham castles and a mighty firework were set alight with innumberable explosions and highflying rockets. Thanks be to the Lord that all passed safely and well. May God grant that this may lead to content on both sides and good neighbourly relations.

219-220. The Edict of Nantes
        Lyons
        21 March 1599
    Fresh letters from Paris of the 15th of this month report that the Edict about religious peace was published in Parliament on the morning of the 25th of February. On the same afternoon the King’s sister started on her journey to Lorraine, but on the way stopped to visit His Majesty at Saint-Germain. The Edict has, however, not yet been published in the city, as it appears that once more something has happened to prevent this.

220. The Baptism of Jews in Rome
        Rome
        15 May 1599
    Early last Sunday the Pope celebrated Mass in the Chapel of San Giorgio. There were there seven Jewish persons, three men and four women dressed all in red. These the Pope baptized himself in the presence of nineteen Cardinals, seven of whom he appointed as godfathers. He named the men after these and gave the women other names, and then caused them to be confirmed and immediately to receive Communion.

221. A Plague of Dolphins in the Mediterranean
        Rome
        10 July 1599
    Twp canons have just arrived here from Marseilles in order to recount to the Pope that in the Sea of Provence there is to be observed such a conglomeration of dolphins that not only do they interfere with the fishing, a most valuable source of revenue, but also with ships sailing on the sea. A Papal Brief has been bestowed upon the canons addressed to their Bishop, in which it is ordered that the matter should be taken in hand by means of prayers in the churches, processions and much fasting. Moreover, the Pope anathematizes this vermin, so that, with God’s help, it may perish.

221. The Leasing of the Spanish Post
        Rome
        26 July 1599
    Don Antonio Taxis, the chief Postmaster in Spain, has determined to lease the administration of his post to Lorenzo Goveto, a Genoese, for nine thousand crowns yearly, by which, so he asserts, he will make three thousand crowns each year.

221. A Big Bankruptcy in Venice
        Venice
        22 July 1599
    On Tuesday the local merchant Signor Finalosa declared himself bankrupt to the extent of four hundred thousand crowns. He has given his assets to his creditors, however, as six hundred thousand crowns. If a respite of six months be granted to him, wherein to pay, he will discharge his debts to every one to the last farthing. But there has come to light a debt of thirty thousand crowns over and above the amount mentioned heretofore.

222. Holland becomes a Colonial Power
        Amsterdam
        24 July 1599
    Out of the eight Dutch ships which left fourteen and a half months ago for India to obtain spices, four arrived here this week. They are richly laden. Their most important consignment is nearly three hundred loads of pepper, which should come to over four thousand packets. The remaining cargo consists of other kinds of spices, such as cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. The ships have a capacity of two hundred and twenty-five, two hundred and fifteen, seventy and forty loads respectively. The other four ships with soldiery have been left at Banca. These have set sail for the Moluccas and are to follow in a few months. This is considered here as great tidings, and much wonder is expressed that they should have taken such a short time over the journey. It took them seven months to make the East Indies and they lay two months in Banca. There they procured all their cargo, and have returned in five and a half months. Never have the Portuguese accomplished such a journey.
    The Indians of Banca traded with them in most friendly spirit, and the Dutch paid the inhabitants of Banca, but with the help of the Dutch, the Indians have killed eight hundred of these and captured the rest with the ships. Whereas the Dutch have succeeded so greatly in this sea journey they will undertake others, and if the King of Spain does not beware and put a stop to them, in time great harm will befall the kingdom of Portugal and the Venetians.
    These ships are valued at three hundred thousand Flemish pounds. They will make yearly a great trade in spices and cause many others to alter their course. The Dutch States wish to go out again to India with these ships and to send an envoy to the King of Banca. They will never relinquish this desire unless the King of Spain prevent them by force.

223. Divorce Plans of Henry IV
        Rome
        12 September 1599
    To-day, on account of the request of the King of France for a divorce, a meeting of Cardinals was held, in which the following three considerations were put forward:
    1. That the King and Queen of France were blood relations and that they had no
        dispensation.
    2. That King Charles IX had, out of fright, almost by violence, compelled them
        to marry.
    3. That at the time they were of different religion.
    Therefore this divorce is to proceed with all celerity. From this it is gathered that the marriage of His Majesty with the Princess of Tuscany will surely take place.
223. Family Tragedies in Rome
        Rome, 12 September 1599
    Cenci’s children were executed here yesterday. The eldest son was rent asunder with two tongs, beheaded and quartered, the daughter was beheaded. The youngest son was forced to watch all this. He was brought from prison and straightway taken back to it. He was pardoned on account of his youth. A nobleman of Rome, Paulus de Santa Croce, stabbed his own mother who was fifty-four years old, because he surprised her in adultery. The murderer, however, escaped through the window. A law-suit has already begun against him and property of his will be confiscated to the amount of seventy thousand crowns.

223-224. The Dutch Harass Portuguese Trade
        Antwerp
        22 October 1599
    Letters from Amsterdam report that a Dutch ship, which had sailed with thirty-six other ships from the Canaries to India, had separated from these and joined two English pirates in robbing a few ships in the Spanish Main. This ship made fast in Texel, which is not far from Amsterdam, but it is not known as yet what goods it has brought. Two Dutch ships have likewise called at Emden with fifteen hundred cases of sugar. Three other ships are expected from Brazil. Dutch navigation to the Indies is becoming ever greater, which will cause the Portuguese heavy damage in their trade.

224. A Miracle in Rome
        Rome
        23 October 1599
    In a Church Cecilia in Trastevere there has been discovered the corpse of the Saint and Holy Martyr Cecilia, perfectly preserved, a linen cloth over her face and dressed in such guise as she went to her martyrdom eight hundred years ago.

224-226. The Counter Reformation in Austria
        Steyr
        30 October 1599
    As already announced, His Serene Highness Ferdinand of Austria and Lord of the Manor of the three countries of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, holding a hunt soon after St. Jacob’s Day at Eisenerz, forthwith displaced two pastors and appointed in their stead two Catholic priests. When, however, His Serene Highness had left for Graz, the two above-named priests were again driven out of the parish. His Serene Highness was very much displeased and immediately dispatched some commissaries to reinstate the two priests. He also gave them six hundred troopers from Croatia and Slavonia, in order that, should the inhabitants of Eisenerz prove obstinate, they might enforce his will with an iron fist. These arrived here fourteen days ago and the community and the miners wanted to oppose them in arms. Thereupon the commissaries promised them that no harm should be fall them from the soldiers, and that the desires of the inhabitants of Eisenerz should be respected.
    The Commissaries were then allowed to enter the town, and they won the game, for immediately thereupon they arrested the heads of the municipality, the aldermen, burgesses and others. Also every one had to deliver his arms in the market-place and the soldiers were quartered in the town. Thereafter the two priests were reinstated by force and seven gibbets were erected in the marketplace, of which two were just in front of the Town Hall.
    On the next day the provost with his retinue also betook himself there, so that he could begin with hangings, beheadings, impalings and other torments, tortures and agonies, to find out by means of suffering whether there was an understanding between them and other places and districts. Altogether it is a grievous state of affairs. Every one who can, flies from the parish. Women with their children are driven from their houses and are obliged to watch in terror and pain the miserable existence of their husbands. Although it was intended to execute the ring-leaders and the heads of the town at once, it is said that Imperial Commissaries have arrived these last days, who have sternly forbidden, in the name of His Majesty, any harm to be done unto any man or to put any one to the rack or torture. It is greatly hoped that His Majesty will show mercy.
    The Commissaries are also due to travel these days to Aussee, Schladming, Gröbming, Neuhaus and Rottenmann, in order to proceed with this matter everywhere. That this should take place with more speed, the governor, Count Wolkenstein, has collected three hundred of his own peasantry in the field one mile from here so as to unite with the other troops. As, however, most of them belong to the Evangelical faith, they are not reliable. When the need for action comes, they will not yield obedience. Three weeks ago His Highness had the collegiate church in Graz forced and caused the chairs, the altars, the company flags and the gravestones of former sovereigns to be pulled out and hacked to pieces and the whole church emptied. For what purpose he now wishes to use it is uncertain.
    The secretary of the local council of Graz, Herr Gabelhofer, is still imprisoned in the castle in that place. None of his acquaintances are allowed to see him. The secretary of the Carinthian Council, Herr Kantelberger, has died of torture, after great agony. The motive of this was to find out the intentions of the local council; but he would divulge nothing.

226. Death Sentence on the Earl of Essex
        Antwerp
        31 December 1599
    There is no news yet from England as to how matters stand regarding the peace with Spain. Otherwise there is information that Lord Essex stands in great peril of his life, as sentence has already been passed upon him. As, however, some noblemen have interceded for him, it has been postponed. But the Queen still holds him in strong custody.

226. The Year of the Jubilee in Rome
        Rome
        1 January 1600
    Although the Pope was not quite free from gout, he was yet unwilling to put off the opening of the Holy Gate any longer on account of the large sums which the Hospital of the Holy Trinity was spending on the great mass of Pilgrims who have crowded the town. Therefore, on the last day of December, he had himself carried in pontifical vestments to the Church of St. Peter, accompanied by all his cardinals, bishops, the foreign ambassadors, his clergy and retinue. There, after he had reached the other door with great difficulty, and after the Antiphones had been sung, he opened the Holy Gate with the usual ceremonies. Although the Swiss Guards had beaten back the crowds with their staves, the journey of the Pope was very tedious. Whereupon the cardinals also opened the gates of the Churches of St. Paul, St. John and Our Blessed Lady under a great concourse of the people.

227. Decree Forbidding the Export of Coins From Rome
        Rome
        29 January 1600
    The Pope’s chamberlain, a cardinal, has had all the local and foreign silver coins valued anew and has made a decree that no one in future should take away from here more than five crowns.

227. The Monastic Life of Pope Clement VIII
        Rome
        12 February 1600
    The Pope is quite determined to lead a monastic life as an example to the whole world. On account of this he has already ordered all carpets and ornaments to be removed from his rooms and especially from his sleeping chamber, allowing nothing to remain therein except a bedstead, a table and several skulls, as he wishes only to lie between four walls. Near him sleep two Benedictine monks, who stand in very good repute. He has summoned them to his presence, in order to pass his time with them and only to think of spiritual matters.

227-228. Clement VIII hears Confessions
        Rome
        8 April 1600
    Last Saturday the pope sat in the chair of the Chief Penitentiary in the Church of St. Peter with a white rod in his hand, and heard confessions there for three hours, granting the people absolution. Among these were many pilgrims, such as the Viceroy of Naples and the Duke of Sessa, as well as the bandit chief and the former most intimate adviser of the Sciarra. These the Pope touched on the forehead with the white rod.
    On Tuesday the above-named Viceroy and his wife, also the Princess of Castelvetrano, dined with the Pope, and the day before yesterday Cardinal Aldobrandino gave the Viceroy a sumptuous banquet served at five tables. After dinner a hunt of all kinds of deer was held in the courtyard of the palace.

228. The Remarriage of Henry IV
        Rome
        6 May 1600
    It is learned that the Grand Duke of Florence has given a royal banquet in honour of the French Ambassador and of the new Queen of France, at which the Queen sat, under a canopy to which there were two steps, at the head of the table, and that M. de Selleri sat next to her. The Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess waited upon them at the table with many other noblemen and noblewomen, and the Bracciano-Orsini and two Princes of Medici. The above-named Grand Duke has given a beautifully trained horse as a present to M. de Lincourt and the latter has immediately left for France.
    The Queen is so beautifully and well-proportioned a woman and is adorned as well with so many virtues and the fear of God that it is hoped that much happiness may accrue out of this marriage for the throne of France. As the Cardinal Aldobrandino will travel with the new Queen to Marseilles and after that to Avignon, in order to show all honour in the name of the Pope to the King and has affianced wife, the galleys of the Pope have already been set in readiness, and provisioned with biscuits at Naples.

228-229. Wholesale Murder in Savoy
        Rome
        6 May 1600
    The afore-mentioned rascally persons, who caused many deaths in Piedmont and especially in Fassano, where the young Princes of Savoy are living, and who in many places have rubbed poisonous ointment, were yesterday executed in most woeful fashion. Next week more of these people are to be judged, amongst them a barber who prepared the ointment, and has confessed that he murdered therewith more than two thousand people, as though this poison it was possible to spread the plague.

229. England and Holland Conquer the Trade of the World
        Antwerp
        2 July 1600
    From Holland and Zeeland we get written tidings that four ships from the East Indies and others from the West Indies have again sailed into Plymouth in England heavily laden with spices. Altogether they have brought ninety loads of pepper, which are estimated at about 324,000 lb.; also cloves and mace. Besides these there are nine other ships expected in Zeeland, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The consignment of the two ships which have recently come from the Moluccas amounts to 620,000 lb. of nutmeg, 65,000 lb. of mace, 35,000 lb. of cloves and 700 lb. of pepper, which altogether is estimated at 230,000 Flemish pounds. In exchange these two ships have carried away with them 300,000 Flemish pounds in cash. It is said that six more ships are due to sail for the East Indies, namely four of the old and two of the new Company. This route becomes therefore of universal use, which is very harmful to the Spaniards, because it has been decided in Holland and Zeeland that this journey should be made through Portuguese and Spanish waters. It is announced from Emden that a ship has come here from Pernambuco in Brazil, the sailors of which report that the fleet of the United Provinces with seven ships have captured two forts in Brazil, and that afterwards they attacked the town and carried off between seven and eight thousand cases of sugar.

229-230. Conferences of Philip III of Spain for Purposes of obtaining Credit
        Rome
        17 June 1600
    The gentlemen we named recently who a short time ago were resolved upon arranging a new financial transaction with the King of Spain, are now, for lack of ready money, no longer wishful to lend him these sums. For this reason they have begged the gentlemen of the Monte San Giorgio to pay the deficit required to complete the needed amount, in return for which they have offered to place in the Monte as much fine gold and silver as would be necessary as a security. This, however, was refused, and therefore His Majesty suffers from some lack of cash. Although the Spanish kingdom had declared itself prepared to advance six more millions as Assignation on the fleet which is due to arrive, and to pay the royal debt therewith, this money has not been found to be sufficient. The merchants, who are concerned in this, have offered to withhold their loan in the meantime, in order that the intended Assignation may be extended until the arrival of the fleet.

230. The Dangers of Sea Voyages
        Cologne
        18 August 1600
    Two ships the Lion and the Lioness belonging to Balthasar Monseron in Zeeland have arrived home from Madagascar with thirty loads of pepper and with some white ginger. They have had a bad voyage and have endured great dangers both afloat and on land on account of the savages. These gave them to drink of an intoxicating beverage, which they took full of trust. Owing to this they all became unconscious and for three whole hours the ship was besieged by the savages and nearly lost. But those on board the Lioness fought the savages so bravely that the latter had to abandon her. However, eighty men who had landed perished. These savages, therefore, should not be trusted.

230-231. A Persian Embassy in Prague
        Prague
        12 October 1600
    About 4 o’clock in the afternoon yesterday, the Persian Embassy, about thirty strong, arrived here. They were met as far as the Royal pavilion on the Stern by close on three hundred well-equipped horsemen and two captains of the town, namely Herr Popel and the chief steward and Lord Chancellor Herr von Schönberg with the Imperial dapifers and servants of the Court, and over and above thirty coaches, each drawn by six horses. These accompanied them as far as their quarters, “The Wild Man Inn,” on the Klein-Seite. Four hundred armed men were likewise placed in front of the quarters of the Ambassador, who therefore has been met and received in very fine fashion. The Embassy has now been on its journey for about one year and a half during which time sixteen of its members have died. They went across India and by sea round the whole of Africa. They intend to conclude an alliance with His Imperial Majesty against the Turks; this is to be taken as the sign of special Divine dispensation likewise, as nations so far distant come to us in Germany, an omen of great changes in the future. The head of the Embassy is an Englishman and he is short and dressed in English fashion. The most important next to him is an elderly grey-haired man, a princely official of the King of Persia, attired in Turkish dress, as are likewise his servants. Whereas so many of the Ambassador’s Persian servants died during the journey, he has taken into his service Englishmen and Frenchmen. The Embassy was greatly amazed at the great concourse of people who had come together from the three towns of Prague.

231-232. The Capture of the Fortress of Kanizsa by the Turks
        Vienna
        10 November 1600
    It is all over with Kanizsa. The enemy, unfortunately, has it in his hands and has allowed our troops to withdraw. Colonel Paradeiser is expected here every day to render accounts for this event. It is reported from different sides that the Turk is making strong incursions along the frontiers and that this coming winter he will give us much trouble, and perhaps even seek a sight in our territory.
            Vienna, 15  November 1600
    On the 14  this month the former Commander of Kanizsa arrived here for the inquiry fixed for the 1st day of December and is staying with Herr Ferdinand Kolonitz. The servants, however, lodged at the inn, “The Golden Ostrich." The Commander was immediately informed by His Highness the Archduke Mathias that he should not only prepare in writing his defence of the surrender of Kanizsa but also report on the course of the siege from day to day. Time will show how this will be.

232. The Death of the Cardinal of Austria
        Rome
        18 November 1600
    The Cardinal of Austria died last Sunday morning. The body was opened and it was found that the lungs and the liver were defective. The corpse was accompanied by all the members of the Order and the Pope’s own servants to Santa Maria di Anima, where it will remain until a message is received from the Margrave of Burgau as to whether he will have the body brought to his Bishopric of Constanz. The Cardinal was wont to receive thirty thousand thalers from his Bishopric, thirteen thousand from the Bishopric of Brixen and eighteen thousand from the canonicates in Suabia. In Spain he received yearly ten thousand kronen from the Bishopric in Toledo; he also held the ecclesiastical sinecures in Germany, which His Imperial Majesty would very much like to transfer to one of the members of the House of Austria. It is believed, however, that the chapter will be given a free choice.

232-233. Yet Another False Don Sebastian
        Venice
        22 December 1600
    Last Friday the Privy Council ordered that the man who has lain imprisoned here for so long, and who makes himself out to be King Sebastian of Portugal, should leave Venice at daybreak and the territory of this State within three days. If, however, he should not do this and be again caught, he would be put in irons for ten years in the galleys and, if he be not fit for this, be kept in strict durance for the rest of his life.

233-238. A Letter from Peru
        Lima
        27 May 1600
            background: Copy of an epistle which Father Bartholomeus Descouart dispatched to Father Egidius Bauerius from Lima, which is the capital of the Province of Peru.
    Reverend Father,
    I write to your Reverence through Father Emanuel Vasquez, and in order to avoid circumstantiality, I enclose herewith the copy of a letter which the Fathers of the College in the small town of Arequipa have addressed to the Father Visitor Stephen Paex, which runs thus: “It is only meet that there be recounted unto you the strangest happenings which have ever taken place in the world, those which we experienced but lately with great fear and are partly still enduring in the town of Arequipa; they are as follows:
    “On the first Friday of Lent, which fell on the 18th day of February of this year 1600, on the evening of the said day, after several slight earthquakes had occurred on the four preceding days, the shocks began to assume such frequency that not even a quarter of an hour would elapse without an earthquake taking place. Up to one hour after midnight all the people had to stay outside their houses, at which time still stronger and more violent shocks caused these to sway. Whereas an improvement was confidently expected after dawn, the calamity took such proportions that Holy Mass could not be celebrated. As, however, the concourse of people to our church was so great, we prepared to celebrate Mass. But hardly had this ceremony begun at 8 o’clock, when the earthquakes became so violent that the people incontinently fled from the church and, at the sight of such obvious danger, we regretted that we had begun Mass. This anxiety and misery therefore waxed the greater the longer they lasted, and this went on till 6 o’clock at night, in such fashion that within twenty-four hours there were two hundred such strong and terrific shocks that all the buildings collapsed thereupon with the exception of the smaller ones. Because of the continuous disturbances and vibrations people have betaken themselves to a safe spot outside their houses.
    “On the same day at half-past 5 in the evening, the sky became covered with dark clouds, heavy thunder was heard, and there arose suddenly an unusually strong squall, after which we looked for a cloudburst and torrential rain. This did not occur, but instead there dropped from the clouds a mass of thick white sand. With violence and turbulence this went on and slackened not for two hours of the night, and in this time there roared such heavy thunder that we resigned ourselves to the expectation of the end of the world. Lastly, we heard such pitifully howling voices in the air that one believed that many legions of evil spirits were travelling about in the sky; and it was impossible to recognize either from the uproar or any other circumstance whether this was a natural occurrence, or rather the cursing and the raving of demons. Now, because this howling continued and the rain of sand was ever increasing, nor did it stop for the whole of the night, although the roar and rush had become somewhat quieter about 2 o’clock, the people filled all the squares with plaintive and resounding clamour, so that one might have thought that the Day of Judgment had come. The populace did not trouble itself about anything except confession and the bemoaning of their sins, self-castigations and beating of their breasts, and thus collected within the churches from which they led processions with unusual devoutness.
    “On the first Sunday in Lent the whole of the town and the surrounding country were covered in white as if snow had fallen thereon. The ground throughout was covered about half a yard high with thick sand, which had to be thrown down from the roofs in order that they should not collapse, and our new building or hall which had been erected shortly before, was demolished thereby. At midday the darkness thickened once more, and at 2 o’clock of the afternoon the night and fog became so opaque that we could not see one another. Whereas the Father Rector was preaching at this time to the people, we had to lighten up by means of burning torches. At half-past 4 thinner sand began to fall and the heavens became clearer and the atmosphere a little lighter.
    “On the following Monday the sky was somewhat darkish and overcast, whereat the people took fright and burnt lights for meals at noon.
    “On Tuesday from 9 o’clock in the morning until 3 o’clock in the afternoon it rained ashes, so that hair and beard became clogged, or stiffened completely. This caused great damage to the weaker trees and the crops so that their entire destruction was feared. On Wednesday and Thursday it became a little quieter, although the trembling of the earth and the rain of sand and the darkness of the air had not entirely disappeared. On Friday there was hardly seen any daylight at all, but much fog and lightning, and thunder was heard by day and night.
    “The Saturday also dawned rather dark and, besides this, there was a continual quaking of the earth. The sand, moreover, fell so thick and fast that it seemed as if it had been thrown down in buckets from the heavens above. It became necessary to sweep it, by the light of burning torches, from the roofs, which were beginning to give. Altogether it might have been taken to be the Last Judgment, and there was such dread, mourning and howling among the people and in the air that it was indeed a wretched sight, and everything looked like inevitable death and extinction. In spite of all the foregoing, the population, both secular and ecclesiastical, were not to be prevented by the rain of sand from performing their processions and their supplications, bareheaded and barefooted. This same day, there was such a terrific earthquake that we expected total extermination and every one spent the night in the churches.
    “On the following Sunday it turned lighter, so that we could see each other. But the shocks continued and the rain of sand did not stop, although it became somewhat less heavy. At 10 o’clock there occurred another mighty earthquake with a terrific upheaval of the earth. On Monday it was again much clearer and there was more light. There came, however, another heavy earthquake. But at 3 o’clock in the afternoon it became pitch dark and the lightning and the thunder became so awesome that we fain expected the end of the world. A wind that arose from inland drove the thunderstorm with the darkness out to sea, and gave us back daylight. On the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday it became quieter and more peaceful, the earthquakes were likewise less violent and the day lighter; but it remained so overcast that one could see neither the sun nor the moon. On the Thursday at eventide there fell a thick, cloudy darkness, which was followed by a tedious rain of sand which lasts to this very hour of writing, that is to say, up to midday of the following Friday, when it has become somewhat more clear.
    “Through this sad and painful existence, the people have covered themselves in ashes and have also castigated themselves. They have wandered about helpless and at random, undertaking all kinds of practices, such as Confession, Communion, other penitential exercises and processions with the Cross. Lamentations and sermons were heard night and day, and there was no one who did not show great sorrow and remorse, however nefarious and godless his life. The sand and dust, which had fallen, stretched around us for forty-eight miles along the roads, and it is to be feared that most of the herds have been damaged or have possibly perished through it. We are, however, consoled in this that the sand has not dried up the fruits of the field, although it has laid low a great many, and nearly all the fruits on the trees. The cause of this plague is supposed to be the volcano near Omate, which place or mountain lies eighteen miles hence. This mountain has opened up and vomited forth stones and fire through which five or six villages, which lie round it, were destroyed and laid waste. It is given out as a fact that for twenty days running there was a continuous thick and dark night. In the village of Omate there fell one after the other stones weighing five and seven pounds each, through which sixty persons were killed. The houses are all buried in sand, which lies to a far greater height than they. We have heard nothing as yet from the other villages which surround the volcano, but it is now reported that the rain of sand round Chupaca and Chuquisaca has extended causing much havoc, over forty miles towards the sea.
    “The bed of the strong river Tambo had been filled by sand in the short space of a day and a night, so that the river has overflown its banks with such violence that it has spoiled the whole valley and rendered it barren.
    “In the valleys which are called Victor and Lignas, whole streams of sand have rooted up the houses and the huts, and they have also covered to a great extent the vines and the oil-trees. Taken all in all, this marvellous story is utterly unbelievable. Great damage has been done to the cattle, for unless it rains they must perish, as even now they are already dropping and dying in large numbers.”
    Here ends the letter from Arequipa.
    The ships which arrived across the sea were swept upon by the rain of sand between Arica and Chile, and brought to such straits that the mariners and other people on board did not know what would come out of this heavy, dark stormwind. Word has been received from Potosi that the sand and the ashes have reached as far as there. When one reflects upon this, all places up to one hundred and forty miles from here are covered in sand. And if all places are to be counted in circumference of earth and sea, then the rain of sand spreads for over six hundred, forsooth, for over a thousand miles. That the noise was also heard two hundred miles away was so curious that the Fathers of the College in Arequipa truly considered this as the labour and work of the evil spirits, for, however strong it may be, no one can hear thunder more than eight or ten miles off. The letter quoted above was brought hither on the 1st day of May and it was announced that the stormy weather still holds. May the Lord God take pity on this kingdom and I pray your Reverence to commend it faithfully to Divine Omnipotence. A final cordial greeting to your Reverence.
    From Lima, 22nd day of May anno 1600.
                            BARTHOLOMEUS DESCOUART.

238. The Execution of the Earl of Essex
        Antwerp
        23 March 1601
    It is written from London that Lord Essex, together with one of his most distinguished companions, belonging to the nobility, has been beheaded there in the Tower. This, however, is kept quite secret, as the causes of the conspiracy against the Queen likewise are not yet divulged. It is also said that the Queen has not confiscated the estates of the Earl, but has given them as a present to his young son, whose godmother she is, from which it is gathered that she is graciously disposed towards this young Earl.
        Cologne, 4 March 1601
    Letters from Amsterdam report that the executioner who carried out the sentence on Lord Essex with the axe was frightened to such an extent, that he first of all slashed the Earl through the shoulder, then through the head and lastly through the neck and this in most grisly fashion. Great sorrow has been excited thereby not only in England, but also in Holland and Zeeland among the common people, for the said Earl was greatly devoted and attached to his religion.

239. Journeyings in the Olden Days
        Frankfurt
        10 April 1601
    There is nothing new here. The Margrave of Ansbach has arrested on his territory all the merchants who, with their goods, were travelling together from Nuremberg to Frankfurt. However, the next day he released them and allowed them to proceed on their journey. Four of the most respectable merchants of Nuremberg, namely Baumgartner, Pfaundt, Schwenigshöfer and Ketzer, were retained as hostages and as a security, because the town of Nuremberg had imprisoned, twelve days earlier, one of the captains of the Margrave, Scharenberg by name. The said captain had dangerously wounded a woman through a sword thrust. What will ensue from this time will show.

239-240. Persecution of Jews sin Prague
        Prague
        5 April 1601
    A short time ago there died here the Jew Meisel. Notwithstanding that he had left His Imperial Majesty ten thousand florins, and much cash also to the Hospital for poor Christians and Jews, His Imperial Majesty on the following Saturday, viz. the Sabbath of the Jews, ordered Herr von Sternberg, at that time President of the Bohemian Chamber, to enter the Jew’s house forcibly and to seize everything there was. The widow of Meisel handed this over willingly, for she had already set aside and hidden the best part of the treasure. That which was taken away came to forty-five thousand florins in cash, besides all manner of other things, such as silver plate, promissory notes, jewels, clothes and all kinds of coins. After this, however, the President, against whom the Jewess and the sons of the two brothers of Meisel had raised a strong protest to the privy councillors, was not satisfied with all this money and booty, and no doubt at the command of His Majesty, once more broke into the house at night. The son of one of the brothers was taken prisoner, secretly led away and tortured in such guise that he confessed to the executioners, as a result of which the following substance was handed to the Bohemian Chamber:
80,000 ordinary single ducats of 2 florins apiece make  . 160,000 florins.
  5,000 pure golden Portugalese of 20 florins apiece make   . 100,000 florins.
15,000 pure golden Rosenobles of 4 florins 5 kreuzer 
    apiece make . . . . . .   61,250 florins.
30,000 turnip ducats of 2 florins apiece, make  . .   60,000 florins.
10,000 Styrian ducats of 2 florins apiece make  . .   20,000 florins.
60,000 silver thalers of 70 kreuzer apiece make . .   70,000 florins.
Together with the above-mentioned   . . . .   45,000 florins
    Make altogether . . . . . 516,250 florins.

240-241. Punishment for the Fall of Kanizsa
        Vienna
        10 October 1601
    Colonel Paradeiser was wont to have with him a jester who waited upon him at table and fetched and carried the dishes. Upon the 9th day of this month Herr Paradeiser donned the jester’s clothes and came down as far as the third stairs. But when the guard noticed that he had taken to his heels and that he was not the jester, they pursued him and again took him back to his place of imprisonment. There they now keep even closer watch over him.
        Vienna, undated
    Paradeiser’s speech before his decapitation:
    Whereas according to the will of God and that of the Supreme Authorities I shall and must die on this day, I acknowledge myself before God and before the whole world to be a sinful creature, and that I well deserve temporal and eternal punishment. I have felt from the bottom of my heart real and veritable contrition and sorrow, and for that reason beg every one, and God also, for compassion and Christian forgiveness. But violence and injustice are being done to me before God and by the Supreme Temporal Authorities because I shall and must die on account of the Castle of Kanizsa, which was entrusted to me. Never was I convicted of this wrong and with a clear conscience I consider myself innocent before them, because I remained steadfast against the enemy of the name of Christ. This I plead here and in after life before the Countenance and the Throne of Judgment of Jesus Christ, before His Imperial majesty, before His Royal Highness’s Council of War and before all those who in this world have passed such judgment upon me, so that the righteous Judge Almighty may demand of them vengeance for my innocent blood. I am now ready to die and commend my spirit and soul into the hands of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. So be it. Amen.

241. Terrible Tidings from Rima-Szombath in Upper Hungary
Rima-Szombath
          6 April 1601
    Above the river Bodrog, near Lica, there were seen and heard wondrous signs, to wit the sound of trumpets, whereupon two powerful hosts attacked each other and shot with heavy cannon. This caused large cannon balls to fall upon the earth, so that the people who were working in the vineyards could find no refuge but had to run from one place to another and hide. This is also imputed to the priests of Ungvár, and in confirmation thereof Báthory has examined forty persons from that neighbourhood who had witnessed and confirmed it.

241-242. Bankruptcy in Antwerp
        Antwerp
        25 May 1601
    During the past Sunday an Italian of the name of Melchior Nigroni left this town in all secrecy for Paris, and, since he has appointed no attorney to handle his affairs, his creditors, with the permission of the authorities, entered his house, in order to examine his bills of exchange. These were found to balance with his books. Nevertheless apprehension is felt that there may accrue from one place or another many bills and drafts made out by him, which may be the cause for his absenting himself. For this reason a serious bankruptcy is feared.

242-243. A Lansquenet Bears a Child
        Piadena in Italy
        26 May 1061
    A weird happening has occurred in the case of a lansquenet named Daniel Burghammer, of the squadron of Captain Burkhard Laymann zu Liebenau, of the honourable Madrucci Regiment in Piadena, in Italy. When the same was on the point of going to bed one night he complained to his wife, to whom he had been married by the Church seven years ago, that he had great pains in his belly and felt something stirring therein. An hour thereafter he gave birth to a child, a girl. When his wife was made aware of this, she notified the occurrence at once. Thereupon he was examined and questioned as to how this had come to pass. He then confessed on the spot that he was half man and half woman and that for more than seven years he had served as a soldier in Hungary and the Netherlands; in proof whereof he produced his genuine passport. When he was born he was christened as a boy and given in baptism the name of Daniel. In his youth he learnt the handicraft of a smith, which until this day he had practised simultaneously with his soldiering. He also stated that while in the Netherlands he only slept once with a Spaniard, and he became pregnant therefrom. This, however, he kept a secret unto himself and also from his wife, with whom he had for seven years lived in wedlock, but he had never been able to get her with child. When the aforesaid Captain heard of this he informed the Church authorities, who thereupon sent a notary to ascertain the facts and report thereon. After this event had been proved in this wise, the christening of the child was finally ordered to take place. Herr Reitner, Ensign from Wenigarten, in lieu and stead of the Captain, stood sponsor with several noble ladies at the christening of the child, which was named Elizaabeth. This christening was celebrated with many ceremonies and in the presence of soldiery, such as drummers, pipers and three trumpeters. Many noted men and women in the nobility as well as five hundred soldiers accompanied the child home again from the christening. The aforesaid soldier is able to suckle the child with his right breast only and not at all on the left side, where he is a man. He has also the natural organs of a man for passing water. Both are well, the child is beautiful, and many towns have already wished to adopt it, which however, has not as yet been arranged. All this has been set down and described by notaries. It is considered in Italy to be a great miracle and is to be recorded in the chronicles. The couple, however, are to be divorced by the clergy.

243. Persians are Baptized in Rome     
        Rome
        9 June 1601
    Last Wednesday the Persian Ambassador left this town together with some of his retinue. In addition to the honours already accorded to him, the Pope presented him with three thousand crowns. Before the departure of the Persian, however, three of his servitors, his secretary, his barber and his cook, separated themselves from him in order to remain here and be baptized in the Christian Faith. The Pope is to give them ten crowns monthly, and he is in hopes that the King of Persia may likewise abandon the Musullman Faith.

243-244. The Siege of Ostend
        Antwerp
        13 February 1604
    Good hopes are still entertained of Ostend, because the Marquess Spinola with great assiduity is pushing on the completion of the water palisades on which he is placing cannon in order to prevent the ingress and the egress of shipping. If this can be achievd he will soon conquer the fortress. But this week as is reported by letters from Bruges, the north-east wind brought a further forty ships with soldiers, victuals and ammunition to Ostend. A week ago the besieged and our men are said to have caused each other much damage with great cannon from night until the following forenoon, each side losing many of their men. Time will show who sustained the heaviest losses.

244. A Joust in Vienna
        Vienna
        12 March 1604
    Last Sunday we had here a magnificent tournament and tilting at the ring, accompanied by wonderful pageants. Among others there came one von Tiefenbach with one hundred fenceres, poor, blind, crooked and lame mendicants in rags and tatters, just as they sit in the streets and beg for charity. He himself headed the procession disguised as a beggar, wearing garments of many colours and full of stains. They all shouted for alms. It was a sight passing strange, such as had never been witnessed before in this town. To some it gave pleasure, but to others it caused annoyance.

244. Expulsion of the Catholics from England
        Brussels
        27 March 1604
    It is also reported that all Catholics are to leave England on pain of death. Should any one of this religion be met with in future, all his property and fortune are to go to his nearest friends. It is a subtle scheme to induce one friend to denounce the other, wherefrom it will be gathered what is to be expected from this King.

233. Incendiaries in Bohemia
        Prague
        4 July 1604
    After there had been many fires caused by the doings of wicked people, not only in the Prague cities, but also in the whole of Bohemia and great damage had been done, the magistrate here intended to execute some of the incendiaries. But since that night a further seven of these miscreants were brought in, and therefore the execution of the first evil-doers was postponed so that the others might be examined all the better.
    Only a few days ago, His Imperial Majesty had had arrested an artist and alchemist, Philip Jacob Güstenhöver of Offenburg, together with an Englishman and cast them int6o the White Tower. Rumour has it that they are to be taken to Castle Pürglitz.

245. Tribute for the Pope
        Rome
        3 July 1604
    On the day of Peter and Paul, after the Pope had heard Mass in the Capella Clementina and was about to return home, he received through the Spanish Ambassador, underneath the porch of St. Peter, the usual bills of tribute from the King of Naples, namely seven thousand crowns. This Ambassador was accompanied to his palace by five hundred mounted soldiery, among them many noble princes, counts, squires and thirty-six prelates. These, as well as the Ambassadors of His Imperial Majesty, of the King of France, of the Venetian Government and of the Duke of Savoy, he kept with him and treated to a banquet that cost more than four thousand crowns. This palace was entirely hung with gold and silver tapestries, worth a great fortune. In the palace yard there had been erected a fountain wherefrom flowed throughout the day the best of wines. The most delicious dishes were served on silver and gilt vessels and also many beautiful show dishes made of sugar, triumphal arches, castles, pyramids and all kinds of animals were put upon the tables and later on distributed among the Ambassadors.

245-246. Attempt to Poison Henry IV
        Venice
        16 July 1604
    From Lyons is written the following news: It is reported from Paris that the King of France wished to partake of Holy Communion on the day of Corpus Christi and had already opened his mouth to receive the Host. Suddenly a dog appeared, who pulled the King backwards, so that he could not take the sacred wafer. When the King, the second time, prepared himself to receive Holy Communion, the said dog once more prevented him from partaking of the Host and pulled him back. Thereupon the King commanded the priest to receive the Host himself. The latter refused, whereupon the King ordered him in all earnestness to do so. When the priest had taken it he swelled out and burst in two, because this wafer alone had been poisoned and not the others. Thus it was that a plot was discovered, and several of the most noble participants have been imprisoned in the Bastille.

246. Madame d’Entraigues’ Plot
        Rome
        25 July 1604
    From France there arrives the report that Madame d’Entraigues has decided secretly to send her five-year-old son, whom she begat with the King of France, to Spain and to surrender the city of Nantes likewise to the King of Spain, all this with the assistance of her father and the Count of Auvergne. This plot was revealed to His Majesty, whereupon he caused the Count of Auvergne as well as three other councillors to be arrested. Madame d’Entraigues he forgave because she was his mistress. The Count of Auvergne fled from the Court, the King sent him with his sons and daughters to St. Germain to be kept in safe custody there.

246. The Persian Embassy in Prague
        Prague
        26 July 1604
    On the 20th day of this month the Persian Ambassador with his retinue had audience of His Majesty. When he arrived the Persians sought to kiss his right foot. But His Majesty did not wish to permit this and offered his hand alone. After the Ambassador had presented his respects he withdrew with a deep obeisance. Thereupon His Majesty also invited the suite to salute him, and they promptly approached on their knees and kissed his foot. This Ambassador and his following are being magnificently entertained.
    These days a young Herr von Schönberg, whose late father was Field-Marshal in France, was most pitifully wounded and hacked about in such fashion that he had twenty wounds in the neck alone, and forty wounds and cuts on his body and his head. He was on his way to the house of Messer Adam Popel to make love to his spouse.
        Prague, 2 August 1604
    The Persian Ambassador gave latterly a magnificent banquet. On that occasion he was questioned by His Majesty and others as to how the air in this country suited him. The Ambassador made reply to this that he had not felt very well, but that since he had paid his respects to His Imperial Majesty, he was fully recovered. Thereupon the Emperor ordered a large goblet of wine to be handed to him and desired that a toast should go round to the health of His Holiness the Pope, His Imperial majesty and the King of Spain, further expressing the wish that he should also quaff a draught on behalf of the other kings, such as those of Poland, of England and the rulers of Venice. Since, however, he is more of a Mohammedan than a Christian, this he refused to do.

247-248. The Fall of the Fortress of Ostend
        Antwerp
        24th day of September 1604
    The fortress of Ostend, which had been beleaguered for three years and two and a half months, has just been surrendered by agreement into the hands of Spinola. Upon the 22nd day of this month, at 10 o’clock of the forenoon, two thousand five hundred soldiers of the General States marched, with all their arms and four pieces of heavy ordinance, upon the town of Sluys. Although Count Moritz of Nassau, as is reported in letters from Middelburg dated the 14th, set forth by ship with twenty thousand men on horseback and on foot as well as with twenty-four cannon, for which journey twenty thousand loaves had been supplied to him in Zeeland, he was unable on account of a head wind, and also of the heavy firing from Spinola’s palisade, to land in the port of Ostend, in which there were most of his men.
    Since the troops of the General States, terrified by the constant firing, were unable to resist any longer, they were obliged at last to surrender.

248. The Establishment of the Dutch in Brazil
        Antwerp
        12 November 1604
    We have tidings from Amsterdam that two merchant ships from Brazil have arrived there with sugar. They bring the news that the five men-of-war with many soldiers on board, as well as the two ships with munitions and provisions which were last March to accompany the ships sailing from East India, remained in Brazil. There they have robbed all the ships laden with sugar, taken from them four thousand cases and pillaged all the inhabitants. They remained on the mainland of Brazil for six weeks, and then decided to build a fort at a place called Bahia and to retain possession of the country.

249. Extraordinary Occurrence at the Imperial Court of Prague
        Vienna
        8 December 1604
    From foreign parts comes the news that, a short while ago, His Imperial Majesty wished to betake himself to his apartments through the corridor at his right hand. Thereupon the eagle, who has his stand in the courtyard by the cistern of the fountain, flew towards His Majesty through the corridor and into his own chamber. There, upon a take, a snow-white dove was to be seen, whereat His Majesty was greatly surprised, for it was unknown to him that white doves were bred in that part of the country. When this was bruited about, elderly people were heard to remark that during the lifetime of the second Kaiser Maximilian a white dove had also shown itself in his chamber, coming from the blue, and this just before His Majesty had travelled to Regensburg to the opening of Parliament, where he gently passed away in the Lord shortly hereafter. But since nothing of this matter has been reported from Prague, it cannot be easily believed.
