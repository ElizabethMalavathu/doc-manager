587.  London Bankruptcies, Deaths and Births
              Antwerp
              January 17, 1597.
  The only news from London dated 8th inst. is that the late heirs of John Baptist Cagoria have failed.  John Baptist Giustiniani has fled the country.  He is said to owe £3000.  There were in London last year 3496 deaths, 1300 of them from plague.  On the other hand, 4841 children were born.

588.  The English Doctor of the Prince of Juliers
              Cologne
              January 23, 1597.
  The English Doctor who is to attend the Prince of Juliers is here.  The Councillors demand that he should first give proofs of his skill on others.  They also wish to address a question to His Imperial Majesty, so as to get His Majesty’s opinion.
  italics: John William, last Duke of Juliers, Cleves and Berg, 1562-1609.  During most of his life he was mad.  He was married to Jacobea, Margravine of Baden, and caused her to be assassinated for alleged adultery in 1597.  Sybilla, 1557-1628, was married for the first time to Philip, Margrave of Baden, for the second time to Charles of Austria, Margrave of Burgau.  After the death of John William a furious quarrel broke out over the Juliers succession.

589.  Flour Prices up fourfold at London
              Antwerp
              February 15, 1597.
  London letters of the 9th inst. report that the ships Charité and Mignon after a nine weeks’ voyage have arrived from the East with a large quantity of spices, drugs and silk stuffs.  Also a ship called the St. Cherubin and some others from Malaga have come in with wine and dried fish.  The scarcity still continues.  Flour, formerly costing 2 ½ Rhinegulden, now comes to 10.

590.  The Queen’s Gifts to the Sultan
              Venice
              February 28, 1597.
  They write from Constantinople that the Queen of England has presented the Grand Turk with two pairs of beautiful gold clocks.  One looks like a galley and strikes every hour, the other shows the movements of all the planets in the heavens.

591.  House Tax in England
              Antwerp
              March 1, 1597.
  They write from Middelburg on the 27th February that two Hamburg ships have been confiscated in England for having munitions on board.  The Queen of England keeps work at her fleet going on hard.  Her agent has been here to ask for the help of 40 to 50 vessels.  Also all houses in England have been scheduled and a tax imposed.  The City of London alone contributes £30,000.  It is not yet known what for, though it is guessed that they are going to sail to Corunna and there destroy and burn the ships, which are in great confusion.  So the Spaniards will have enough to do in all directions.

592.  The Queen tries to draw England, Ireland and Scotland together
              Antwerp
              March 15, 1597.
  They write from London that the Queen is determined to send Lord Essex to Spain next spring with the fleet at which they are working so hard.  She has sent Lord Borough to Ireland with full powers to come to terms with the leaders of the rebellion about all matters in dispute.  The King of Scots has not only promised to pardon the three Earls exiled for religion and rebellion, but has urgently commanded his Ministers to be reconciled with the Church.  Some Ministers, however, and the common people object to this, so the unrest is still fairly great.  This King wanted to quarter 400 horse in Edinburgh, but the inhabitants refused.  They promised His Majesty £1000 to make up.

593.  The Queen’s Designs in North Africa
              Rome
              March 22, 1597.
  Spanish letters report that great preparations are being made with fighting men on sea and land and that the Queen of England is also wasting no time.  She intends to throw her entire force into Mauretania for the benefit of the King of Morocco and Fez.  In this way she will bring pressure to bear upon Spain, as with the help of these Moors she will invade Spain and capture certain towns.

594.  £300,000 in Taxes
              Antwerp
              April 26, 1597.
  London letters of the 2nd inst. say that they are still hard at work on the fleet so that it may sail about the middle of May.  The destination is still unknown.  It is also reported that at the Queen’s Arsenal of Dublin in Ireland a fire broke out which burnt all ammunition and did great damage.  The Queen has collected over £300,000 in taxes from her subjects all over the country in order, as is said, to help the King of France.

595.  The Prince of Juliers and the English Doctor
              Cologne
              May 1, 1597.
  The Prince of Juliers has submitted to the care of the English Doctor.  If he cures him he will gain great honour.

596.  Detention of Merchant Ships for War Purposes
              Antwerp
              May 10, 1597.
  From London of May 3 we learn that all ships are being detained there, and that the same thing is happening in all the ports of the country.  They also write from there, and this is confirmed by the vessels from San Lucar and Lisbon arriving at Middelburg, that 200 Spanish sail are at sea.  Vessels reaching Middelburg confirm that 6 English ships have taken the island of San Martin and built a fort there.  They also aver that the King of Spain is detaining 120 Netherlands ships.

597.  Spanish Traitors
              Rome
              May 10, 1597.
  We hear from Spain that Hieronimo Lomenino, an important man of business at Granada, has been beheaded, and his property amounting to 40,000 crowns confiscated by the government.  He has been sending money secretly to Genoa in bales of wool in order to get it to the King of France.  The money was found in the bales.  The Corregidor of Malaga has been stabbed by a Captain who accused him of being a traitor to his King.  At the Corregidor’s were found some letters from the Queen of England.  So there is treason enough on all hands.

598.  The English Fleet to be ready for Sea
              Brussels
              May 14, 1597.
  Letters of the 5th inst. from London say that the Queen has earnestly enjoined upon her commanders that they should go on board with their crews, so that they may be available at once, and be able to sail out in good order to the destination named.  In the meanwhile the Queen has sent vessels to Biscay, Portugal and Galicia, to find out what the Spanish Armada means to do.
  They write from Holland that the States General have sent some of their warships to join the English fleet.  The Queen has urged them not to take the field, but simply to hold their frontiers and send their remaining troops to the King of France.
  The Queen has also not yet settled the disputes about the Licences.  Only her greed is at fault, and if she does not soon find a remedy it may be her ruin.
  They also declare that the King of Denmark has entered into an alliance with England, France and Holland.

599.  Forty Ships have already sailed
              Antwerp
              May 27, 1597.
              background: London Bankruptcies
  From Middelburg on the 22nd comes the report that the English have already despatched 40 ships to the island of San Martino and have occupied an island near Cartagena.  So some of the Spanish Armada vessels have put out to anticipate the English.
  Giuliano Roniter and his Company have failed in London.  Many merchants in London and also in the Netherlands are interested in this.

600.  London Bankruptcies.  Fall in Price of Corn
              Antwerp
              June 7, 1597.
  Letters from London of the last day of May report that 50 corn-ships have come in there from various places.  So corn which was previously costing 100 Rhinegulden has fallen by 16 to 18 gulden in a week.  But business is quite ruined by the scarcity.
  In three or four weeks a big fleet is to sail.
  Antonio Bay, Christopher Bonart and several others also have failed in London.  Roniter and Leville owe £26,000.  They are ready to repay with interest and without surety in four years.

601.  The Prince of Juliers incurable
              Cologne
              June 12, 1597.
  According to all appearances the English Doctor will not manage to restore the Duke of Juliers to his senses.  So he will lost greatly in credit and reputation.  If he had been able to help His Serene Highness it would have been a useful thing, as he would thus have been able to keep together the Duchies of Juliers, Cleves and Berg with all their dependencies.

602.  More Financial Distress in London
              Antwerp
              July 21, 1597.
  Of the recently mentioned English bankrupts Jaques Joan has actually fled.  Many sound people have interests in this firm.  His master, who came over from London and from whom he had embezzled a large sum of money, was so upset about it that he killed himself in his own warehouse, although despite the loss he is still reckoned worth £20,000 and was a man of 60.

603.  English Troops for France
              Brussels
              June 28, 1597.
  Letters from England of the 18th inst. announce that the newly raised troops are already assembled and have been armed at the Arsenal in London.  They are to be taken at once to Boulogne in France.  It is thought certain in England that, with the help of these men and of other foreign contingents, the King of Navarre will set about the recapture of Calais this very summer.  For the English troops a large number of shovels, pickaxes and other implements of the sort, together with military engines, have been shipped.  These are to be carried over to France simultaneously with 500 miners taken from the tin and lead mines in Cornwall.
  The Queen is now at Greenwich at the French envoy’s.  But it is said that she may be leaving for Canterbury any day.

604.  An immense English Fleet to sail with the first fair wind
              Antwerp
              July 5, 1597.
  From London dated June 28th we hear that the fleet is ready and that all Captains and soldiers have come to Dover to sail with the first fair wind.  But nobody knows the destination except General the Earl of Essex and four other persons.  It is also stated that never has such an Armada put to sea since the English have waged war.  They have over 600 brass guns on board and can if necessary discharge 200 shots at each broadside.

605.  Junction of the Dutch and English Fleets with those of Jersey, La Rochelle and
  Bordeaux
              Brussels
              July 12, 1597.
  They write from Holland that their ships have already joined the English Armada.  Don Antonio’s son is said to be on board as well as 18,000 men, not counting the nobles who go at their own expense.  Admiral Howard is to block the Spaniards’ passage to England.  At the island of Jersey are nine more fully equipped vessels which are to join this Armada.  They have been fitted out by the merchants of La Rochelle, Bordeaux and other places at their own expense.  From the Tower of London have been brought a quantity of arms of all sorts, and munitions and 30 big guns, kept hitherto for cases of dire necessity.  The Queen is to make her Court at Dover, so as to be nearer to France in case of eventualities.  Some emissaries from France also are to wait upon the Queen to furnish security for war expenditure on behalf of France.  The Queen has summoned Colonel Norris from Ireland.  He has reduced it to order.  She has sent the King of France 10,000 soldiers to reinforce him and will pay them herself till the end of October.  Norris she has made a General.

606.  The Fleet has sailed in two divisions
              Antwerp
              July 19, 1597.
  From England through Zeeland we have reliable tidings that the English Armada with the warships from Holland and Zeeland, 120 sail strong with 12,000 to 15,000 soldiers without counting the sailors, has sailed in two groups, one on the 8th the other on the 10th.  The wind is fairly good.  Where they will go, the Lord God alone knows.  Those whom they attack are greatly to be commiserated and pitied.  It is said that this Armada has only taken provisions for four months, so it is thought that no long journey is to be made.

607.  It has been sighted at Sea
              Brussels
              July 26, 1597.
  A vessel arrived in Holland from Portugal reports that it met the English Armada at sea.  They say the fleet is going straight to Africa and Barbary to stir up the Moors, of whom 200,000 from all provinces are assembled.  Then they will at once descend upon Spain.  The English have laden vessels with all sorts of weapons so as to equip the unarmed Moors.  Of the Spanish Armada we only hear that the Count of Fuentes, the General, has moved out to offer resistance where required.  Antonio Perez seems to have been despatched by the Queen of England long ago to the King of Fez to negotiate about the rising of the Moors.  He is with the Armada himself.

608.  Some say it has been scattered by a Gale
              Antwerp
              August 16, 1597.
  A vessel from Galicia has arrived at Middelburg.  Those on board say that they met 54 to 60 ships of the English Armada off the Galician coast.  The English took off their pilot and ordered them to say they were sailing towards the Spanish fleet.  Others again assert the contrary, that the English fleet has been completely scattered by gales, so that only a small portion of it has returned to England.  But we shall soon hear something more accurate, as the wind from Spain is fair.

609.  The King of Morocco apologizes to Spain
              Venice
              September 19, 1597.
  It is announced from Spain under date August 12 that the King of Morocco has sent four of his chief Moors to the King of Spain to apologize for having an agreement with the Queen of England.  It looks as though he were rather less than contented with the Queen.

610.  The English Fleet off Lisbon
              Antwerp
              September 27, 1597.
  By letters from Lisbon we learn that five ships very richly laden have arrived from India.  They say they saw many vessels off the Canaries, but could not be certain whether it was the English fleet.  But letters from Lisbon report that this fleet has sailed by quite close to Lisbon on the look-out for the Indian ships.
  They write from London on the 20th inst. that the envoys from Denmark have been cordially received and granted an audience.  Their objects are, firstly, the renewal of the friendship between the two kingdoms; secondly, the return of property looted at sea; thirdly, free navigation to Spain.  As a fourth point they offer that their King shall act as intermediary between England and Spain.

611.  The Jesuits assign England and Scotland to the King of Spain
              Rome
              October 4, 1597.
  As the Pope is again ill in bed all business is at a standstill.  Even though His Holiness trusts Cardinal Aldobrandini, the latter is unfamiliar with the affairs of the States of the Church, and there are only a few people who do know anything about the matter.  Accordingly the Spanish ambassador has complained to the Pope about His Holiness having accepted a document delivered to Him.  This document states that the King of Scots is to succeed the Queen of England on her death; but the Pope is adjured to use every effort to restore these two Huguenot kingdoms to the Papal religion.  Against this document the Jesuits have composed one assigning the succession in the above-mentioned kingdoms to the King of Spain and his heirs.
  background: Cardinal Aldobrandini was made a Cardinal at 22 years of age, and during the reign of his uncle Pope Clement VIII managed the political affairs of the States of the Church.  He was born in 1572 and died as Archbishop of Ravenna in 1621.

612.  The English Fleet off Corunna 
              Antwerp
              October 28, 1597.
  It is reported from Amsterdam that the English are having to leave Holland because, at the desire of the English and for little reason, trade with Moscow has been forbidden to the Netherlanders and only the English are admitted.
  From England we learn that all they know of their fleet is that it is lying near Corunna waiting for the Spaniards to come out.
  Great honour has been shown to the Danish envoy, but what he has accomplished is unknown.

613.  Alliance between England and Denmark
              Antwerp
              October 31, 1597.
  They write from Amsterdam that the Danish envoy has gone home.  He confirms the alliance concluded between Denmark and England.  The Queen told him she did not wish to change the Danish alliance, but she could make no peace with the King of Spain, because he had designs on her freedom, her life and her country.  She has removed the embargo on navigation to Spain.

614.  Marriage of Emanuel of Portugal with Emily of Nassau
              Brussels
              December 27 1597.
  The marriage of the sister of Count Maurice of Nassau to the son of Don Antonio of Portugal, who calls himself a Prince from Portugal, had been celebrated.  The ceremony was performed at the house of Admiral Egmond at the Hague in presence of that Admiral and of many other Huguenot gentlemen.  Count Maurice was not present, and bride and bridegroom have fled to Wesel as he is in pursuit of them.

615.  France disposed for Peace
              Antwerp
              January 30, 1598.
  The General of the Franciscans has come back to Brussels with the announcement that the Council of State in France has decided to meet for peace negotiations.  So the Cardinal has sent President Richardot, and the King of France Monsieur de Villeroy with his First Secretary from Paris to St. Quentin to inquire whether peace is attainable.  If it looks promising the Duc d’Aerschote and the Marquis de Havré are also to be sent to France.  Many hope for peace.  Others say on the contrary that the King of France has asked the Queen of England and the States of Holland and Zeeland for a large sum of money and many troops, with the statement that he will not abandon them if they grant his desire.  Therefore the Hollanders are holding a meeting at Dieppe, and it seems as though they would not be in agreement with the King, if he were to make a separate peace with this country.
  It is reported from London that the scarcity there still continues, and that the Earl of Cumberland is ready to sail with his ships.  A fresh Armada is being prepared for the spring, and the Queen has nominated the Earl of Essex Marshal General of her dominions and commanded him to carry on the government in place of herself.
  background: Nicole de Neufville, Seigneur de Villeroi, 1542-1617, French Secretary of State, supported the League under the last of the Valois, but later took up the cause of Henry IV.  He, together with the French Cardinals, succeeded in bringing about the reconciliation with the Pope.  To the day of his death he had great influence with Henry IV and his second wife Marie de Médicis.

616.  English Envoy to the Diet of Ratisbon
              Cologne
              February 7, 1598.
  An English envoy reached Deutz opposite Cologne lately with 50 horses.  He was accompanied by Hollander servants, and has gone on to Frankfurt to attend the Imperial Diet at Ratisbon.

617.  Overtures for Peace between Turkey and the Empire
              Gran
              February 1, 1598.
  The present Vizier Pasha seems to set far more store by the favour of the Emperor than Ibrahim Pasha, and would like peace to be concluded.  But the Sultan will not write the first letter, and is said to have requested the English envoy in consequence to begin the negotiations, and to write to the Woiwode Michael and advise him to send the tribute.  It is thought that this would be the beginning of a peace to be concluded between His Majesty and the Turkish Emperor.  This is why the English envoy has been sent to the Prince of Wallachia, to give him every information and to ask him to impart what he has learnt to the Emperor through one of his envoys.

618.  Threatened Expulsion of German Merchants from London
              Antwerp
              February 2, 1598
  They write from London on the 24th ult. that this Queen has published an order there that all Baltic and German merchants are to leave the country and take their property with them.  This is because the English has been expelled from the Empire.  At the same time the Queen has sent an envoy to His Imperial Majesty to arrange the matter on friendly terms.  The English and Dutch peace deputations are likewise quite ready to start for France.  They are only waiting for a favourable wind.  The King of Navarre is said to be demanding from the Spaniards the return of his kingdom of Navarre, with all captured frontier towns and payment of all costs and damages.  The English and Dutch insist on the other hand on being allowed to sail to Spain and the Indies and to carry on their business without hindrance, like the Portuguese, and on the removal from their Provinces of all foreigners, especially Spanish and Italians.  It will probably be hard for the Spaniards to grant this.
 background: The departure of the Germans from the Stalhof in London on Aug. 4, 1598, marks the end of Hanseatic power in England.  See Fugger News-Letters (First Series), Letter 187, Expulsion of Hanseatic Merchants.

619.  The Prince of Juliers still not cured, Doctor useless
              Cologne
              February 12, 1598.
  The Prince of Juliers is still at Hambach, and the English Doctor has accomplished little so far with his drugs.  The Estates think of holding a session at Essen to consider whether they shall make His Serene Highness marry again.
  Letters from Dordrecht report that at Scheveningen, near the Hague in Holland, a whale has been caught, 20 ft. long and 16 broad.  This the Hollanders consider a good omen.

620.  He is much better, so the English Doctor is some good after all
              Cologne
              February 12, 1598.
  The Duke of Juliers is getting on so much better as regards his mind that it is thought the Councillors of His Serene Highness will soon permit him the use of sidearms again.  It looks, therefore, as though the English Doctor who is still always with His Serene Highness would accomplish something useful.

621.  The Indian Fleet still at the Azores
              Antwerp
              February 28, 1598.
  The Indian Fleet which has been lying at the Azores has not yet reached Seville, and as it is believed that it will start for Seville this March, the Earl of Cumberland has prepared to put out with 36 ships and lie in wait for the fleet.  They hope at Middelburg that the question of the expulsion will be amicably solved between the English and the Empire.  The vessels for India are ready to go, and 10 are to sail from Middelburg, each one taking 120 sailors and nearly 100,000 Rhinegulden.  If they have good luck this trip they will bring back a large store of spices and other things.

622.  Death of the English Envoy to Constantinople
              Venice
              March 8, 1598.
  Constantinople reports that the English envoy to this Court died on the 28th January.  All the Pashas and the Sultan himself regret his loss, for he was such a likeable man that he was always expected to be in attendance on the Sultan.

623.  The Dutch and the English do not believe Peace possible
              Antwerp
              March 14, 1598.
  We learn from Middelburg that the States General and the English think the peace merely built upon sand, especially since the Spanish soldiers have come into Calais.  So both sides are arming and we shall have no peace to welcome this summer.  The Baltic traders have been allowed to prolong their stay in London by one month.  It appears also that emissaries have been sent to the English about their return to Staden.  They have let it be understood that they do not propose to go there again unless His Imperial Majesty allows them again complete freedom, and other German Princes and gentlemen furnish security to the same effect.  They mean to make sure that they can never again be ejected and exiled at a moment’s notice, as in the present case.  But this the Princes and gentlemen will not readily do, so trade with the English will probably remain at Middelburg for some time yet.

624.  Funeral of the English Envoy
              Venice
              March 20, 1598.
  They write from Constantinople on the 11th February that the funeral of the late English envoy was carried out with great solemnity and attended by many distinguished gentlemen and representatives of foreign countries.  His Agent is accepted to act in his place pending further instructions from the Queen.

625.  Possible War between England and Scotland
              Venice
              March 27, 1598.
  There is quite a circumstantial rumour here that the King of Scots, with the help and assistance of his brother-in-law, the King of Denmark, has determined to make war on the Queen of England if she nominates the Earl of Essex as her successor on the ground that to him, the King of Scots, belongs the succession to this kingdom before all others.  If this is the case, the Queen will probably leave Spain unattacked.
  background: The King of Denmark at this time was Christian IV, 1577-1648.

626.  Danzig Ships for the Polish-Swedish War
              Antwerp
              May 5, 1598.
  We hear from Amsterdam that some ships have arrived from Danzig and report that all ships at Danzig are being detained.  It seems that they are to be used for the war of the King of Poland against Sweden.  They also report that four English cloth-ships have arrived in the Sound but have been confiscated for not showing their goods to the Customs.  This will cause many failures among the English.

627.  Report of Peace between France, Savoy and Spain
              Middelburg
              May 14, 1598.
  This time we have nothing particularly fresh to write.
  We hear from Antwerp that peace has been concluded between France, Savoy and Spain.  The text of the treaty has been sent to Spain and to the Pope for ratification.  But about our country and England we cannot yet know.  The whole story has been thought untrue in default of any report from France.  We hear from Moscow that the Prince is dead and the English there have had to leave the country.  They seem to be attacked just now on all sides.

628.  Satisfaction in Venice
              Venice
              May 15, 1598.
  A messenger from Ferrara reached the government here to-night with the news of conclusion of peace between the two crowns of Spain and France.  The conditions are at present unknown.  In consequence of this there have been great rejoicings among many supporters of the Roman Church here, as it is hoped that Turkey may now be more readily reduced and that the King of Spain will be able to send a great Armada to Africa, Greece and Cyprus.

629.  Another Conspiracy against the Queen
              Cologne
              May 21, 1598.
  At Middelburg when closing their letter they heard of a conspiracy in England and of a nobleman who, at the instigation of the Jesuits, was intending to kill the Queen, but, as we have letters from London dated the 9th and making no mention of this and I hear nothing further about it from Middelburg, I cannot believe it.  The letters from London of the 9th mention only that the deputation from Holland and Zeeland which had been sent there has returned home well pleased, but of peace nothing is said.

630.  The Dutch look forward to more war yet
              Middelburg
              May 21, 1598.
  The bad weather has again done much damage in several parts of this country.  After receiving information that 3000 to 4000 Spanish soldiers have again come out, the English have sent warships to Ireland and Brittany.  Our warships are destined for Calais and Dunkirk.  Our envoys, previously in France, have been in England and returned from there this evening.  Of the peace with France I do not approve, and if it is the fact we shall have to stand the racket alone.  They seem to be arming again in England and in Spain likewise, so that things may well happen at sea.  We have news here too that the English and especially the Earl of Cumberland with 30 ships are off or near Lisbon, and have taken four very richly laden Spanish vessels bound for India.  So the other ships with cargoes for India, both in San Lucar and in Lisbon, will have to unload again.

631.  Confiscation of Dutch Property in Spain
              London
              May 23, 1598.
  The news we have to report is that a vessel, which took 11 days to come here from the Canaries, informs us that all ships are being detained throughout Spain, and that Hollander and Zeelander goods are being confiscated.  It is feared that our will fare the same, for the Earl of Cumberland with 27 ships is off Lisbon.
  As the Irish have risen again, warships have been sent from here to crush the rebellion before the Spanish can set foot in the country.
  Our deputies have returned here from France, have had audience with Her Majesty and have journeyed back to France again.  They inform us that peace between France and Spain is concluded, but before it is arranged with England much time will elapse.  The deputies from Holland and Zeeland had also arrived at Dover.  The Queen summoned them before Her and gave them and their suites a splendid reception.  From this it is inferred that Her Majesty will not agree to peace without the consent of the Hollanders and Zeelanders, unless it were a general peace.  But something important must be going on, as these delegates have been sent back so quickly to France with Earl Buckhurst.  It seems that the Spaniards are not behaving honourably, for a nobleman was arrested a few days ago and accused of designs on the life of the Queen.  Others again say this happened for a different reason, so that one can be certain of nothing.

632.  Peace between Spain and France not to include England or Holland
              Middelburg
              June 4, 1598.
  It was announced a week ago that the French had arranged a separate peace with the Spaniards, and that England is excluded.  The Frenchman is to get back all his towns, move in and out.  And so our countries will have to carry on the old war with the Cardinal again.  It will last a long while, for so long as this King of Spain lives no peace can be expected on our side; we must go on with the war.  As the Frenchman is going to sit there neutral and do nothing for our country the English will have to be careful.  After lying outside Lisbon for some weeks and stopping ships from sailing, the Earl of Cumberland has gone off to Brazil.  Yesterday and to-day many ships have come out from San Lucar, Lisbon and Portugal and made for Holland.  Two vessels also have arrived from India with hides, woods, gold and pearls.  Vessels are likewise daily expected from Spain.  The people of La Rochelle have carried off two ships from Spain.  The English do not yet know where to go to with their ships.  Their representatives arrived from England yesterday and have been magnificently welcomed and entertained at the Town Hall.  They are now to go to Delft to have a look at the place.  If they can find a port that will do for their ships they will choose it, but at present it is not known what place they will take.

633.  Calais returned to the French.  The Queen fights on
              Middelburg
              July 2, 1598.
  Our only news is that the town of Calais has been handed over to the French.  The Spaniards are moving out and taking with them everything that they can lead or carry, so that the Frenchman gets an empty town.  Now peace may be considered certain.
  The rest of to-day’s news is not good, for the English warships met at sea four Hollander and Zeelander merchantmen out of Biscay bound for Holland, and as they would not surrender but defended themselves against the warships, the English sank one by gunfire and took the other three away to England.  They carry a lot of cash, and this is certain neither to reach its right destination nor to be replaced.  If one could at least get back the wool out of the ships one might bear the loss with equanimity.
  The Queen of England has sent an envoy to the States General which are already assembled at the Hague.  He brings the message that the Queen desires to continue the war against Spain and its adherents and to bring all possible pressure to bear.  She requests that the frontiers of Brabant, Flanders, Artois and Hainault be closed.  If this be not done, the Queen will have to make peace with Spain.
  The English clothiers are taking a long time to think things over, and if they do not come within four or five weeks they will regret it.  The clothsellers are already very tiresome, and trade with the English is all the more awkward as they have no bills of exchange.  There is little other business, so that the ordinary man is the loser.

634.  English Cloth for the Continent
              London
              July 5, 1598.
  As for the peace between us and Spain it is universally talked of even at Court.  All depends upon what Her Majesty’s representatives bring back from France, and their return is awaited with great eagerness.  If they bring good news, then various great Lords and Earls of the Council will be sent to France to continue negotiations with that country.
  Two vessels have just come from Zante and two from Patras laden with currants and muscatel and two from San Lucar with 200 casks of wine.  They say that the Earl of Cumberland has taken the island of Teneriffe in the Canaries.  Whether this is true time will show.
  Three vessels have arrived this week from Venice laden with currants, muscatel and the like.
  Up to now the English merchants have not yet decided what place to select for their cloth trade, for the deputies they sent for this purpose to Holland have not yet returned.  Last Thursday four ships with the usual cargoes left here for Staden and Hamburg, but they are still lying off the mouth of the Thames, as an express messenger was sent after them yesterday to stop them.  The reason is this, that the Merchant Adventurers have heard that they are not wanted there.  How this will be settled we shall know in time.  A finer crop of corn stands in the fields than has been seen for twenty years, thank God.  May the Almighty grant a continuance of fine weather so that we may be freed from the scarcity!

635.  Eight Prizes at Plymouth
              Middelburg 
              July 16, 1598.
  The English are still doing great harm at sea.  They have again seized and brought into Plymouth 8 vessels bound for Bayonne laden with corn.  If this goes on long it will cause grievous loss to traders.
  The English clothsellers are taking very long over their decision.  Their deputies returned from The Hague yesterday.  It is hoped that they will come to an agreement and go to Staden next year.  The opinion is that they are not going to make up their minds beforehand, but wish to wait and see how the war turns out.  The States General at The Hague are also undecided about this.

636.  English Raiders recalled
              Antwerp
              July 23, 1598.
  From England comes the positive assertion that this Queen has sent orders on pain of death to all freebooters at sea to leave the sea and come home.  The States General have again sent deputies to England, among them Count William of Nassau.  They are to discuss how to attain peace or whether the war is to be carried on longer.

637.  English Cloth sold at Middelburg
              Meddelburg
              July 23, 1598.
  As the English have not managed to obtain as many privileges as they had desired, they have determined not to conclude a fresh agreement, but to come here in their vessels as usual, sell their cloth and await their opportunity.  Their mouths still water for Staden, and their hopes are centred on the conclusion of a general peace, and on their being able to come to Staden.  But the other party here does not wish to trade with them, for they waste a great quantity of goods.  Peace with France is concluded and the Queen of England leans strongly towards peace, but here the Spaniards are distrusted.

638.  Portugal raided
              Rome
              July 27, 1598.
  By letters from Lisbon we learn that the English made a descent four miles from there and carried off a lot of cattle without meeting any resistance.  All over Portugal unprecedented scarcity prevails.
  We hear from India that the Portuguese have again discovered nine mines very rich in gold and silver.  The Spaniards have arranged with the King of Calicut to conquer with his assistance the island of Ceylon.  From this place much spice will be brought.

639.  Development of London Trade
              London
              28 July 1598.
  Nothing has come in from the sea this week, only the usual vessels from Amsterdam and Holland bringing much valuable merchandise, as the Merchant Adventurers have placed large orders.  Hamburg has stopped sending, and they are trying to forbid our going to India.  The English are beginning to send a lot of stuff to Middelburg and think of remaining there this winter as well.
  The deputies from the States General arrived here this week, to arrange peace or war.  They had an audience with the Queen to-day, but their proposals are not yet known.  Of the Earl of Cumberland there is no news.
  Verone Martens here has failed, but still remains in his house.  He owes more than £12,000, and it is a dangerous time for trade.

640.  Hopes of a General Peace
              London
              August 1, 1598.
  Whether our emissaries in France will do any good with the King we do not know.  The emissaries of the States General are still here.  They demand continuance of the war with Spain, so Her Majesty has despatched six of her Privy Councillors to discuss these important matters from day to day.  The plain man hopes a general peace will be attained.
  The English have arrived at Middelburg with their cloth, bringing a large consignment.  Trade on the Elbe, Ems and other rivers is forbidden to us.  Each man grudges the other a scrap of bread.
  We have heard nothing of the sea or of the Earl of Cumberland.

641.  Good Harvest in England.  Corn cheaper
              London
              August 19, 1598.
  The weather for the new crops remains splendid and they are being carried very dry for the most part.  Corn is much cheaper in the country.
  The English merchants are determined to settle at Middelburg and sell cloth.  Their representatives did not receive so favourable an answer as they had hoped from the States General at the Hague.
  We do not hear a word of the Earl of Cumberland.  It appears that he has not done much.  A vessel with 280 barrels of sugar has taken a month to come here from Spain, but can tell us nothing of Cumberland.
  About peace we have nothing to say either, because no conclusion has been arrived at, and negotiations are kept secret, but a week ago the emissary arrived with the answer of the States General of Holland, and it is hoped that either peace or war will soon be decided on.

642.  English Trade in the Spanish Netherlands
              Antwerp
              August 29, 1598.
  There are strong hopes here that peace with England will be reached; indeed it is confidently asserted that orders have been sent to three towns in Flanders by the Court here to allow the English there to trade freely with their own goods.  Customs alone are to be levied in accordance with long established usage.  And the Flanders people are to be allowed to trade with England.  In this way peace will probably result.

643.  The Earl of Cumberland brings in Thirty Prizes
              Antwerp
              September 15, 1598.
  From Middelburg we hear that the English have arrived with 20 vessels laden with some 40,000 cloths, but they may not sell them till all are stacked in their warehouses.  They will have a good market, as has already been seen in Holland.
  Amsterdam reports that the Earl of Cumberland has again reached England, bringing with him 30 vessels captured from the Spaniards.

644.  Large Sales of Cloth at Middelburg.
              Cologne
              October 7, 1598.
  The English have already sold 12,000 pieces of cloth to Holland alone, and English cloth comes here every day from Holland.  The patterns designed for Germany, however, will probably remain on their hands, as import is universally forbidden, even through Hamburg.

645.  Porto Rico taken by the English
              Antwerp
              October 10, 1598.
  News comes that the English have taken the island of Porto Rico in India, but that the fort is still apparently holding out.

646.  It was looted and abandoned
              Antwerp
              October 23, 1598.
  They write from Holland that news comes from England that Lord Cumberland has returned to England.  He was unable to take Porto Rico permanently but pillaged the place and then abandoned it.  He has brought with him to England a quantity of loot and 150 brass guns.

647.  Debts of the States General to England
              Middelburg
              November 15, 1598.
  There is not much news from London, but the States General of these countries have made up their accounts with the Queen and appear to owe Her Majesty 39 tons of gold.  They have promised to repay this in twelve years, and will put down 300,000 Rhinegulden yearly.  In return Her Majesty releases all towns pledged to her for this purpose.  The States General have also sent men down the Rhine, as the enemy is said to be very strong there.
  On the other hand, the English have had a good market for their cloths and within two days have sold over 10,000 pieces, though this is a small amount compared with the 60,000 pieces they have brought.

648.  Not all the Portuguese Fleet is safe
              Madrid
              November 20, 1598.
  Letters of the 7th November from Lisbon report that the Portuguese fleet has come in safe with the exception of one vessel belonging to the General of the Fleet, and captured by the English near San Michele.  They have also taken in the harbour off Lisbon a vessel coming from Havana with passengers and 40,000 ducats and reals.  They have pillaged and taken home with them also a vessel bound from Lisbon to Angola, another off Cape Verde, and again another from Biscay.

649.  The Irish again
              Antwerp
              November 21, 1598.
  From Middelburg we learn that the Irish have beaten the English again, and will end by driving the Queen’s troops out of Ireland.  Another plot has been made against her life.
  It is also reported that the Earl of Cumberland has not brought back any very great wealth to England.  Dysentery was so serious among his men that he had to hasten home, and had no time to go out after loot.
  A fleet is equipping in Spain to fetch gold and silver, and is expected in February.

650.  Arming by Spain and England
              Antwerp
              January 6, 1599.
  They write from London that Hollander and Zeelander vessels are being detained in Spain and that the King is fitting out a strong Armada.  So the Queen is arming heavily on land and sea, and the Earl of Essex will proceed to Ireland next March with 20,000 men.

651.  James VI appointed Heir to the English Crown
              Venice
              February 5, 1599.
  An English vessel, having first of all accompanied others to Lisbon, has returned thence to England laden with sugar, although it was nominally bound for this place.  Therefore merchants here are seeking some way of detaining in our port four English vessels in order that the ships may be able to sail home in spite of the detention ordered in Spain.  We also learn that the English have captured 23 vessels with munitions and general merchandise bound for Spain and Ireland.
  As the Queen of England, besides the cancer in one breast, has also been attacked by fever so that her life is in danger, she has made a will appointing the King of Scots heir to her kingdom, but on condition of his making incessant war on the King of Spain.  She has also given instructions how this can be done.

652.  A large Army for Ireland
              Antwerp
              February 12, 1599.
  Reports reach Zeeland from England that naval and military preparations against Ireland grow daily greater.  A powerful army is to go there to intimidate the country.  Through recruiting, the numbers of the woolweavers begin to shrink so that English cloth has already grown dearer.

653.  The Pope should help the Irish
              Rome
              February 13, 1599.
  The Spanish Ministers would be gratified if the Pope sent some pecuniary assistance for the war in Ireland against the Queen of England.  This would prevent the King of France from helping this Queen.

654.  Danish, French, Scotch and Dutch Ships must not be robbed
              Cologne
              March 20, 1599.
  The Queen of England has let it be known that friendly relations must on pain of death be maintained with the Kings of Denmark, France and Scotland and the States General of Holland and Zeeland.  Their ships must be neither robbed nor in any other way molested.

655.  Gold for England
              Antwerp
              April 9, 1599.
  The ship of Mr. Muscheron, living at Middelburg, is said to have reached England from the island of Principe near St. Thomas and to have on board goods to the value of 500,000 gold marks.
  Holland and Zeeland report that they are hard at work equipping ships of war.  The Queen of England also seems to be fitting out a good number of her largest ships to send out with other English ships and ships belonging to the States General.  Their destination is unknown.

656.  Doubts about the Turkish Fleet
              Rome
              April 10, 1599.
  By letters of the 19th ult. from Messina we learn that the Turk is to put to sea a fleet of 200 sail and that the Queen of England has offered him the assistance of 25 ships, but on condition of their being used against Spain alone.  So preparations are going on hard all over Sicily but most of all at Messina.  So large a fleet from the Turks is not feared, however, as it is thought that at most they will be able with the utmost exertions to fit out 100 ships only, owing to their great lack of wood and of rowers.  Another vessel from England has arrived at Messina laden on the top with nothing but edibles, but underneath have been found many cannon balls and 40 guns.  These and the whole contents of the ship have been sent to the Viceroy at Palermo.  They were intending to take it all to Constantinople.

657.  The Dutch in the Straits of Magellan
              Frankfort
              April 15, 1599.
  It is confirmed from Holland that the States General have forbidden all trade and navigation to Spain.  They have also ordered that all merchants and skippers who have sustained loss through the detention of their ships and wish to avenge themselves should report to the States General and take out Letters of Marque so that they may be enabled to attack and plunder all Spanish ships and property at sea.
  Amsterdam reports that their three warships which sailed from Rotterdam to the Straits of Magellan with a Frenchman have already seized a vessel from East India with a very rich cargo of gold, silver and general goods, and thrown overboard every Spaniard they found.  The booty has been divided.  The Rotterdamers have sailed back to the Straits of Magellan, and the Frenchman has come to La Rochelle.  This has spread terror among the Spaniards.

658.  Old Mexico
              Venice
              April 30, 1599.
  Of the Indian fleet only one galleon with two millions in gold and a large quantity of cochineal has remained behind.  The newly arrived fleet informs us also that the Spaniards have conquered a new kingdom in India called Old Mexico.  It is inhabited by intelligent people who are to be instructed in the Christian faith.  Very rich gold and silver mines exist there also.

659.  The English allowed to trade with Spain
              Antwerp
              May 1, 1599.
  There is a lot of talk here about peace developments between Spain and England, and the Queen of England has already announced that any one is free to go to Spain with merchandise.  The English are very anxious to go there.
  Further news comes from London that the Earl of Essex in person and his Armada have gone to Ireland.  The rebel Earl of Tyrone is said to be a fugitive, and to have suffered a great reverse from the Viceroy of Ireland.

660.  The Dutch try to stop this
              Amsterdam
              May 4, 1599.
  A London letter states that they have confirmation from Ireland of the arrival there of the Earl of Essex and of his getting the rebellion under.  The Swedish ambassador has had an audience with Her Majesty in the name of Duke Charles, and asked that the friendly relations may continue.  The Queen of England is in good health.  On St. George’s Day she made three Englishmen Knights of the Garter, as well as the landgrave of Hesse.
  The English merchants are much surprised and disgusted that the States General of Holland and Zeeland should try to forbid not only their own subjects, but every one else, to trade with Spain, and that they should respect neither friend nor foe, so that business is made very bad.
  background: Duke Charles, 1550-1611, became King of Sweden in 1604 as Charles IX.  He fought against his Catholic nephew, King Sigismund of Poland.
  Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, 1572-1632.  He abdicated in 1626.

661.  Tension between the Dutch and English in the combined Fleet
              Antwerp
              June 15, 1599.
  About the disposition of the Dutch fleet we have hitherto heard nothing.  But letters from England relate that 48 English warships joined the Dutch fleet off the English coast.  The English wanted to appoint an Admiral over the combined fleet, but the Dutch would not agree and chose an Admiral of their own.  So they were at loggerheads.  But the Queen intervened and made Don Antonio of Portugal’s son, Don Emanuel, married to the daughter of the Prince of Orange, Admiral of the combined fleet.  So with him it then sailed away.

662.  Have the Dutch raided San Lucar, or have they suffered in a storm?
              Antwerp
              June 15, 1599.
  We hear from England that a yacht has come from the Dutch Armada with news that it left them in the habour of San Lucar.  In this harbour they found the Spanish fleet laden with mixed cargoes for India, plundered it, and burnt some vessels.  Thus they have caused great losses and there will probably be many failures.
  On the other hand, others say that the Armada of the English and Dutch has been scattered by storms, that many ships are lost, and that many have been sunk and taken by the Spanish galleons.  What is true in all this we shall only find out by letters from Spain.

663.  Sea-fight between English and Danes
              Cologne
              June 18, 1599.
  We learn here from Hamburg that they are saying there that the King of Denmark has not betaken himself to Scotland, but to the Russian frontier.  On the way seven well-armed English vessels going to St. Nicholas seem to have met him.  They were instructed to cast anchor, but they refused and fired at the Danes.  The Danes replied, and after they had fought each other for two days and a night two of the English ships were at last sunk.  The other five ships were taken, and will have to pay dearly for this dispute.  The King of Denmark is said to be minded in consequence to forbid the English and Dutch to go to St. Nicholas.

664.  The Dutch make 400 per cent. by trade with India
              Cologne
              June 25, 1599.
  Amsterdam confirms the arrival there of four vessels from Calicut.  They have brought so much spice that those who sent cargoes out have made four ducats for one, and this will encourage others to undertake voyages of the kind.  The spice trade of the Spanish and Portuguese will be greatly weakened.  The Indians have rebelled against them and called the Dutch in to help.  Their envoys from Calicut have been in Holland and have returned home with handsome presents.

665.  Anglo-Dutch Fleet off Lisbon.  Will the Genoese help Spain?
              Venice
              July 2, 1599.
  Genoese letters report that 200 English and Dutch vessels have been seen at sea off Lisbon, thus causing great fear to the town as well as to the entire kingdom of Spain, for in that harbour there is no fleet fit to offer any resistance.  His Majesty has therefore sent an express messenger to Prince Doria at Genoa asking him to go to Lisbon at once with his galleys.

666.  Rome says the Spanish Armada is sailing for England
              Rome
              July 3, 1599.
  We hear from Spain that the main Spanish Armada is to sail for England on the last day of June, and that Adelentado is to be in command at sea and the Count de Fuentes on land.

667.  Trade hampered everywhere
              Amsterdam
              July 24, 1599.
  All we hear from England is that the Hamburg emissaries have left with an unfavourable answer and have achieved nothing.  This will not help much.  Moreover, that ships lately mentioned laden with cloth have been forbidden from London to go either to Hamburg or to Staden.  It is also averred that no ship from the Elbe will be allowed to put into an English port.  This will not bring the English any profit.  A ship laden with ginger is said to have come in there from the high sea.
  About the Dutch fleet nothing has been heard, and there is no news of importance about the Irish war, but there is a statement from another source that the Danes have taken four English ships at sea.  This will do nobody any good.

668.  The English must send Ships to India too
              London
              August 7, 1599.
  From the sea and from Ireland there is nothing of importance to chronicle this week.  The wild Irish take to the bush and the woods so that they cannot be got at.  Orders come from Court to get ready 12 warships and 3000 men at once.  Their destination is unknown.
  The arrival of the four ships at Amsterdam has caused great astonishment in England, so merchants here are thinking of fitting out 12 vessels at once and sending them to the East Indies to import spices.

669.  Activity of the Dutch both eastwards and westwards
              Antwerp
              August 21, 1599.
  Advices from Middelburg of the 17th inst. state that the Dutch fleet has certainly taken the island of Canary, and made a very rich capture.  A large number of ships are to sail from there to Spain, and four ships are being got ready at Rotterdam and two in Holland to go to the Indies.  They write from Ireland that the English have not been able hitherto to get control, and have been beaten by the Irish several times.  So the Queen has lately sent over 8000 men.
  Between the Queen of England and the King of Scots great discord has arisen.  The Queen is putting 40,000 soldiers on a war footing, and the English Parliament is giving every assistance, and is extremely hostile to the King of Scots.

670.  Trouble in Scotland and Ireland
              Amsterdam
              August 21, 1599.
  They write from London that the King of Scots wishes to know whether after the death of the Queen he is to succeed her or not.  He has created his son Prince of Wales, so 40,000 men have been armed in England against Scotland.
  The English are doing very badly in Ireland.

671.  Only the French and English may trade with Turkey
              Lyons
              September 19, 1599.
  We are advised from Marseilles that the Turk forbids all Christians except the French and English to sail to or trade with this country on pain of confiscation of property, because he has heard of a projected alliance against him.  This is hard to believe, as it would cause the Venetians much loss.

672.  The Prince of Juliers again ill
              Cologne
              September 30, 1599.
  The Prince of Juliers is again suffering from melancholia as he was six years ago.  The Princess and the Archduchess Sibilla are said to be on bad terms, because the Princess tries to assume control of the government.  London letters report that the Queen there is in good health.  The war scare has died down again and peace is hoped for.

673.  Spaniards again in Ireland
              Venice
              October 1, 1599.
  The announcement reaches here that some ships of the Spanish Armada have got to Ireland with 3000 Spaniards and that these men have killed 800 English.  They are making the natives swear allegiance to their King.  But the most important fortress is still in English hands.

674.  Armistice in Ireland.  Arrest of Essex
              London
              October 23, 1599.
  All I have to chronicle is that our Queen’s Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, the Earl of Essex, has arrived here, having arranged an armistice with the recalcitrant Irish.  Her Majesty is displeased with this, and has had the Earl arrested and placed in safe custody in the mansion of the Lord Chancellor.  There is a strong rumour that the Queen is about to enter into negotiations for peace with Spain, but no envoys have yet been despatched.

675.  Armistice in Ireland
              Antwerp
              October 30, 1599.
  All we hear from England this week is that peace with Ireland is as good as concluded, and that the Queen has arranged a five month’s armistice.

676.  Rumours of Peace with Spain
              Antwerp
              November 5, 1599.
  A messenger recently sent by the Archduke Albert to the Queen of England has returned to Brussels with her answer.  The Queen is ready to enter into negotiations for peace, but the meeting must take place at Boulogne, not Calais.  She has also sent to the States General of Holland to consult them and learn their wishes.  She has informed them that she hopes to obtain the wished for favourable peace from His Serene Highness.
  We hear also from London that 1100 men have made a mutual agreement and subscribed £40,000 with a view to trade in India.  But, when they requested the Queen’s permission for the purpose, she began by asking whether they would not prefer trade with Spain.  On their giving an affirmative answer the Queen signified that they should wait a little while as she was engaged in negotiations with Spain from which she hoped for a good result.  The men were satisfied with this.
  It is also announced that the Irish are reconciled with the Queen of England, and have handed over their ports to her, so that Spain will no longer sail to Ireland and cause unrest among the natives.  But this is incredible, as the Queen has imprisoned her Commander-in-Chief, Lord Essex, for coming from Ireland to London without the Queen’s orders.  As this nobleman is very popular, not only among the nobility but among the common people, there is much anxiety as to the effect of this in England.

677.  The Queen’s Presents to the Sultan
              Venice
              November 5, 1599.
  The presents sent by the Queen of England to the Sultan are said to be a very handsome timepiece and a coach with silver mountings, in addition to many other things, notably some fine pewterwork.

678.  Debts of Philip II to be paid by Philip III
              Rome
              December 11, 1599.
  As the King of Spain of most blessed memory has left a large quantity of debts behind him, the present King has been advised that in the interest of the country His Majesty ought to pay the debts.  A tax is therefore to be imposed on every measure of grain or flour, and it is hoped thereby to collect five millions in gold.  His subjects are to have all their double crowns and silver dollars exchanged.  They are to be broken up and smaller coins minted from them.  Also no large sum in gold may for the future be sent out of Spain.

679.  The China Trade
              Amsterdam
              December 18, 1599.
  A vessel richly laden with gold and silk is said to have reached England from China after a three years’ voyage.
  It is also confirmed that our Armada has captured some 20 Spanish ships estimated at 10 millions.

680.  Peace Rumours disbelieved
              Cologne
              December 19, 1599.
  Nobody will believe until it is made public that the peace between England and Spain is making progress.  The Hollanders and Zeelanders are forming various projects in opposition, and an influential person hears from London under date December 15 that the Queen has been arming with vigour of late and recruiting troops, for the most part horse.  The troops she has had in Ireland are being removed and replaced by others.  Some fresh emissaries have come to England from Holland and Zeeland, to submit new proposals to the Queen.  These were read to the Privy Council in presence of the Queen and at once approved.  The Queen will assist the Dutch with money and continue the war.  As the Dutch are in alliance with the German Princes, the Archduke Albert will doubtless have to set to work to crush them.

681.  Liberation of Catholics in England
              Cologne
              January 9, 1600.
  An ordinary messenger from Antwerp has just come with letters of the 5th inst. to the effect that a special messenger from England to Brussels has passed through with a packet of letters for President Richardot, stating that the Queen of England has liberated all Catholics imprisoned for many years, and not only admitted them to the City of London but given them permission to live where they please in that town or within five miles round.  It is presumed that the Queen is willing to follow the example of the King of France, because she has seen and still sees that all over France the King’s subjects are on friendly terms with each other about religion.  From this good news it may be hoped that after all peace will ultimately be made.

682.  Hopes of Peace
              Antwerp
              January 24, 1600.
  Peace with England is hoped for here, and an envoy from the Queen is expected at Court to begin negotiations.
  The messenger who came from London this week asserts that Lord Essex is dead.

683.  Detention of English Ships at Venice
              Venice
              February 18, 1600.
  Those merchants who suffered loss through the vessel taken, as recently reported, by the English, have obtained from the authorities here the detention of English ships in our harbours.  Those ready to sail are being obliged to disembark.

684.  Sacrilege again by an Englishman in Rome
              Rome
              February 26, 1600.
  On Saturday evening an Englishman dressed as a priest and housed in a monastery was handed over to the Holy Office for having smashed a font and hurled it to the ground.

685.  Gifts from the Sultan to the Queen
              Venice
              March 3, 1600.
  We are advised from Constantinople that the Sultan has sent magnificent gifts of rubies, pearls and diamonds to the Queen of England with a request that she should effect a peace between him and His Imperial Majesty.

686.  The English annoyed with the Venetians
              Venice
              March 17, 1600.
  English merchants here are greatly disgusted at the detention of their ships and goods for reasons unknown, and are awaiting information from England with great eagerness.

687.  Rumoured Betrothal of Archduke Mathias and Arabella Stuart
              Venice
              March 31, 1600.
  Peace between England and Archduke Albert is considered here to be more or less settled, and representatives of both sides are said to be meeting at Boulogne.  It is also alleged that a marriage is being negotiated between the Archduke Mathias and a cousin of the Queen of England, who is successor to the throne.

688.  Restoration of Venetian Property by the English
              Venice
              April 14, 1600.
  Owing to the arrest of English ships that has resulted, the Queen of England has given strict orders that all goods of Venetian merchants still at disposal are to be returned to their owners and what is lost is to be paid for to the last penny.

689.  An English Representative reaches Venice
              Venice, May 5, 1600.
  A few days ago an English nobleman arrived to make arrangements in his Queen’s name with those merchants on the Piazza here who suffered loss by the pillage of a ship.


690.  Probable Marriage between Archduke Maximilian and Arabella Stuart
              Venice, June 2, 1600.
  As for the peace negotiations between England and Spain, discussion will probably include a marriage between the Archduke Maximilian and the Queen of England’s cousin, who is heir to this kingdom.  Although the Turk is vehemently opposed to this peace, and has offered the Queen a strong fleet and many troops to serve against Spain, it is hoped he will fail in his object.

691.  Joyful Return of the English East Indian Fleet
              Cologne
              June 9, 1600.
  The arrival in England of four ships from the East Indies, and besides these of two from the West Indies, has been announced quite recently.  Two of them have already come to Middelburg and were met by two companies of trainbands with music playing and welcomed with joy bells as well.  Although these vessels have brought a quantity of spices they had not enough money to load their holds right up.  One of the vessels, worth more than the two that have come here, was lost near England.  Their cargo consists of 90 loads of pepper, 7 loads of cloves, 8000 lbs. of mace and a small amount of nutmegs.  They took 14 months on the outward, 6 on the homeward voyage, and lay still seven months loading.

692.  Solemn Reception of Converts at Rome
              Rome
              August 12, 1600.
  Last Sunday the Confraternity of the Holy Trinity escorted in procession to St. Peter’s the recently mentioned English, Scotch, Genevese and Germans, some forty persons, who have embraced the Roman religion.  There they recanted in presence of the Governor and Auditor of the Camera and of the patriarch and many other notables.  The Pope gave them his blessing from a window of the new palace and caused the spear with which the side of Christ was pierced to be shown to them and his own countenance to boot.  Also he had them escorted to the palace where the poor priests are lodged and commanded his servant to give them a sufficiency for their sustenance.

693.  Spain and Ireland again
              Brussels
              August 16, 1600.
  It is rumoured that the King of Spain is raising many troops to equip an Armada and some thousands of men for Ireland.  We understand that a distinguished Irish gentleman is affording His Majesty every assistance and handing over some seaports so that the King may be able to attack England to greater advantage.  As a surety of good faith the gentleman is said to have sent one of his sons to Spain to serve there as a page.  The Irish on their side will attack bravely, but on the other hand, the Queen of England appears to be minded also to send an Armada to Ireland.

694.  Mystery Ships for Pirates
              Venice
              September 8, 1600.
  News comes here that Amurad Reis met two English ships not far from the gulf here.  When the latter caught sight of him they made off in small boats, leaving only eight persons on the large vessels.  But they had previously set light to them so that the powder was bound to go off at a certain moment.  So when the Turks went on to the English ships and were pillaging, the fire spread and the ammunition blew up.  On one ship 150 Turks were blown up and their ship also was lost.  When Amurad saw this he sailed off in a panic, so that the English recovered the remaining ship and brought her in here.

695.  Persia to be opened for Trade and Residence
              Antwerp
              October 13, 1600.
  Some people here have received news that the King of Fez and Morocco has sent an embassy to the Queen of England, but its object is unknown.  We hear from Emden that an envoy has arrived from the King of Persia with a suite of sixty people.  They are to journey on to His Imperial majesty at Prague and offer him much assistance against the Turks.  They are ready also to allow all Christians to trade freely in their country, and to be exempt from dues.  They will allow them free exercise of their religion and will build churches.  This would be of the greatest use and advantage to the whole of Christendom.  They have already been 17 months on the journey.

696.  Embassies from Morocco and Moscow in London
              Antwerp
              October 15, 1600.
  We hear from Holland that the visit of the embassy of the King of Morocco to the Queen of England has taken place on the instigation of the Earl of Cumberland.  Since this a mission from Moscow has likewise arrived in London.

697.  More English Ships for the East Indies
              Antwerp
              October 26, 1600.
  They write from England that four large ships on which 800 soldiers are to be put, four similar ones in Zeeland, and a certain number in Holland are being kept ready to sail in company to East India. 

698.  Formation of Trading Companies in Holland
              Cologne
              November 17, 1600.
  We are advised from Holland that some syndicates have already finished the equipment of their ships and will sail off with the first fair wind.  Those of the old Company will follow them.  Monseigneur Caron is having a ship built to send to China.
  Very little is heard of the progress of the negotiations for peace between England and Spain.

699.  What the Moroccans and Muscovites are after is unknown
              Antwerp
              November 224, 1600.
  As it is kept a great secret we cannot yet find out what the envoys of the King of Morocco have effected with the Queen of England.
  Since this another envoy has arrived there from the Prince of Muscovy.
  Nothing is known of his plans either, but some English believe that he has come about the trade which the English have at Moscow.

700.  Dutch and English Indian Trade unwelcome to the Portuguese
              Antwerp
              December 15, 1600.
  Amsterdam letters tell us merely that things are very quiet there, but that any day 13 ships from there, 5 or 6 from Zeeland, and 12 from England may start for East India.  This is how this navigation is kept up, and when these vessels return successful it will increase still more, a thing which ill suits the Portuguese and their voyages to India.

701.  The Dutch will raid the Coast of Portugal
              Cologne
              December 29, 1600.
  The Holland and Zeeland ships equipped for the voyage to India have agreed with each other to sail on the account of one company with combined interests.  As the Portuguese are arming vigorously to stop the voyage, the Dutch are taking some warships with ammunition.  By the spring some 25 ships will have been fitted out to raid the coasts of Portugal, so the Portuguese will hardly be able to prevent the expedition.

702.  More Peace Rumours
              Antwerp
              January 12, 1601.
  News comes from Brussels this evening that the Queen of England has again written to His Serene Highness that both sides should meet to discuss peace afresh.  His Highness has agreed to the choice of a place of meeting, but with the reservation that His Highness should learn the wishes of the King of Spain beforehand.  The Lord grant this may go forward and peace may come!

703.  The Queen mortally ill.  James VI excluded from Succession
              Venice
              February 16, 1601.
  It is announced and confirmed from England that the Queen in Council has issued a decree entirely excluding the King of Scots from Succession to the throne, in order that her nation may not be under the rule of the son of a rebel mother.  She has also already despatched emissaries to negotiate peace with Spain, so that she may leave her kingdom at peace and transmit her Crown to one of her blood relations and assure her of undisturbed possession.  This has already been announced.  She does this because she is suffering from a fatal disease called St. Martha, so that but slight hope exists of a long life for her.

704.  The Essex Conspiracy
              Antwerp
              March 2, 1601.
  According to Zeeland letters they have had news from London that grave turmoil has been caused by four Lords or Earls.  They have taken up arms and a lot of people have been killed.  The Queen gave her pardon to the soldiers who supported the Lords, whereupon the deserted their masters.  Lord Essex, previously General in Ireland and later, on his return, long out of favour with the Queen, has been sent to prison because of this affair.  But who the other Earls were and why the disorder arose is not mentioned.

705.  Arabella Stuart to marry the Prince of Condé
              Venice
              March 16, 1601.
  During the last few days Don Sirley, an Englishman, arrived here in company with the Persian envoy and his suite.  They are to go subsequently to Florence, Rome, and then to Spain, in order to conclude with these powers an alliance against the Turks.
  We hear from London that in the recently mentioned disturbance which arose over the succession to the throne the Earl of Essex was the ringleader.  He has therefore been imprisoned, together with sixteen of his chief confederates.  The Queen is said to be inclined to marry her cousin to the Prince of Condé and he is to be made King.  The King of Scots is to be excluded from the succession.
  background: Sir Anthony Shirley or Sherley, 1565-1633.  He was at first a free-booter who made voyages to Venezuela and Colombia.  In 1599 he, his brother Robert and twenty-five companions were sent by Essex to Persia, where he was ceremoniously received and hospitably entertained by Shah Abbas the Great.  The Shah sent him as ambassador with a Mission to Europe to form an alliance of European sovereigns against the Turks.  Shirley went first to Prague, reached Rome in 1601, and then went to Venice, where he was arrested for intriguing against Turkey.  In 1605 he was sent to Morocco by Rudolph II, in 1609 he led a fleet against the Turks with marked lack of success, in 1610 he went to Madrid and was granted a pension by the King.  After losing this he remained on in Madrid.  He lived in Spain till his death, and left interesting memoirs behind him.

706.  The French intercede for Essex
              Antwerp
              March 16, 1601.
  We hear from England that, together with two or three other Earls, the Earl of Essex has been condemned to death but is not yet executed.  The King of France is said to have sent the Duc de Bouillon to the Queen of England to intercede for his life.  It is also rumoured that this conspiracy was directed against the Queen, and that the Earl meant to invade the kingdom with the help of the ships of the States General, which were pretending to be at sea on the look-out for the Spanish Armada.  Some of his confederates have already escaped, but others have been taken prisoner.  When the execution has been carried out, the Queen will publish the whole story in print.

707.  A Persian Embassy at Rome
              Rome
              April 4, 1601.
  The two Persian envoys made their entry here last Thursday.  The Pope sent out to meet them with a present of three fine horses elegantly caparisoned.  He caused them to be escorted by three hundred horses, and when they reached the Castle of St. Angelo they were received by the firing of the big gun.  They will be very handsomely entertained here at the cost of the Pope.  This embassy has orders to treat with the Pope, and to urge His Holiness and the Christian powers to war against the Turks, and to offer that the King of Persia shall likewise take the field against the hereditary foe with 150,000 horse and 60,000 foot.  The Christian Princes must engage not to make peace with the Turks without his knowledge.  In return he will grant permission to Christians in all his realms to trade, to build churches and convents according to Roman usage, and to live without let or hindrance.

708.  Quarrels of the Persian Embassy
              Rome
              April 15, 1601.
  Up to date the Pesian envoys, being unable to agree about precedence, have not had an audience with His Holiness; but it will take place to-morrow.  The Pope has commanded them in the meanwhile to have their documents empowering them to act and their letters of presentation translated.  The Englishman is to have precedence, but the suites have fallen out with one another because the Persians will not do as they are told.  They have demanded the return of their letters, but this is refused, and in the meanwhile they have armed themselves with daggers.

709.  The Essex Conspiracy.  Executions
              Antwerp
              April 16, 1601.
  Letters from London arriving here this week announce that the whole country is quiet again, and that little is to be heard about the Essex conspiracy.  His Master of Ceremonies and Secretary have since been executed like their master.  It is not known whether others will follow.  The Earl was to have negotiated peace with Spain, but as he is no longer alive there is curiosity as to what the Queen will do now.
  Other letters from London report that a brilliant embassy from the King of Scots has arrived there, and it is thought that this King, being of the blood royal of England, will claim the succession.
background: See Fugger News-Letters (First Series), Letter 222, Execution of Essex.

710.  The Persians received by the Pope
              Rome
              April 26, 1601.
  The Anglo-Persian envoy had an audience with the Pope last Wednesday and delivered his letters of presentation and power to act.  These documents allege that he is the real envoy and the Persian only his assistant.  The Pope gave audience to the Persian envoy the same day, and he, after kneeling thrice, kissed the foot of the Pope in his King’s name.  Then, in accordance with their custom, he seated himself on a cushion and handed the Pope a letter of which the purport is the offer of an alliance by the King.

711.  Tension between England and Scotland
              Antwerp
              June 1, 1601.
  We are advised from England that the envoy of the King of Scots has parted from the Queen in high dudgeon.  This is believed to have occurred over the English Crown which the King has requested for his son, but the Queen will not announce who is to succeed after her demise.

712.  The Persians leaving Rome
              Rome
              June 2, 1601.
  The Anglo-Persian envoy left here last Wednesday.  The Persian will follow him after corpus Christi Day, as he wishes to see the ceremony before going.  Both will proceed to France.

713.  Lenient Treatment of some Essex Conspirators
              Antwerp
              June 22, 1601.
  They write from London on the 14th inst. that the adherents of the Earl of Essex have not been executed but have been fined £20 to£30.
  An envoy from the King of Scots is said to have been dismissed by the Queen with a favourable answer.

714.  Duke Charles of Sweden
              Hamburg
              July 6, 1601.
  The English envoy despatched by the Queen to the Prince of Muscovy has been away thirteen months.  He arrived here via Lübeck from Reval this week with a suite of sixty and announces that Duke Charles of Sweden has beaten the Poles, and has now arrived with his forces before Riga, which he intends to capture.  He now terms himself Duke of Sweden and Governor of Livonia.  At Reveal the English envoy was invited by Duke Charles of Sweden to stand godfather to his child.

715.  Nineteen Dutch and English Ships for the East Indies
              Antwerp
              July 26, 1601.
  Amsterdam letters of the 16th inst. report that the twelve Holland and Zeeland ships sailing to the East Indies have been joined by seven English ships for the same destination.  They met twelve Spanish galleys and fought them for some time, but what vessels have been lost on the two sides is not yet known.

716.  The Spaniards besiege Ostend
              Antwerp
              August 3, 1601.
  We do not hear that His Serene Highness has thus far accomplished anything of value before Ostend.  He has apparently taken a trench, but this is not much use, as the States General have thrown up an entrenchment outside the fortress, which they hold with 3000 men.  His Highness has not been able to block the harbour either, as four English warships are lying off it on guard.  Any day 4000 English soldiers may come to Ostend and 500 nobles at their own expense, so that the capture will be arduous for His Highness and cost him dear in time and men.  His Highness is not yet lavishly provided with troops for the siege either.  An Englishman diguised as a farmer recently went to Maestricht, to find out whether the town could be captured by treachery, but he was caught and brought a prisoner to His Highness in camp.

717.  The Spaniards besiege Ostend
              Antwerp
              September 9, 1601.
  At Ostend there is no change, and the entrance to the port is not closed.  The storms have done much damage both to the town and also to our camp.  They write from the camp that His Highness had come to an arrangement with some of the English nobles in Ostend for the surrender of the town, but this was discovered, and the Englishmen were arrested and the ringleaders taken to Flushing.  Nevertheless His Highness is resolved to continue the siege of Ostend.

718.  50 per cent. Profit for Dutch Shareholders
              Cologne
              September 9, 1601.
  We are advised from Amsterdam on the 3rd inst. that the profits of the four East Indian vessels recently arrived are to be distributed to shareholders.  Each one is to receive 50 per cent.  Pending the arrival of the other two vessels belonging to this Company, three more ships are to sail for East India this autumn.

719.  Spaniards in Ireland to be starved out
              Antwerp
              December 21, 1601.
  News comes from London that the English Governor in Ireland holds the Spaniards so closely in their redoubt that they cannot get out to fetch provisions.  Notwithstanding that eight vessels have come for them from Hamburg with food and munitions, the English seem to mean to starve the Spaniards out.

720.  Peace certain
              Venice
              January 2, 1604.
  Peace between England and Spain will certainly be concluded, so the Customs dues imposed in Spain will be abolished again.

721.  Execution of Raleigh
              Cologne
              January 8, 1604.
  We are informed from various sources that Sir Walter Raleigh and other nobles in England have been executed.

722.  He is to be imprisoned for life instead
              Antwerp
              January 9, 1604.
  London letters of the 19th ult. state that Sir Raleigh was led to the place of execution, but an order was at once sent by the King that he was to be taken back to prison.  So it is thought that he may be imprisoned for life.  It is announced that the King will conclude peace between Spain and England without delay.

723.  Pardon of Don Antonio Perez
              Rome
              January 16, 1604.
  Don Antonio Perez, who formerly escaped from Spain, has obtained pardon from his King and desires to return to Spain.

724.  Fresh Wealth in Peru
              Venice
              February 13, 1604.
  We hear from Seville that a new island, very rich in gold and silver, has been discovered in the West Indies.  It is said to measure 2600 miles in circumference.  Five hundred ecclesiastics have gone on the fleet to Peru and New Spain in the hope of bringing this island under the dominion of the King of Spain.

725.  England still supporting the States General
              Antwerp
              February 27, 1604.
  Just recently we have heard nothing from England worth writing down, but from Holland they write that three Regiments of Swiss are to join the States General.  Under a General named Vere they are waiting for 7000 English and Scotch soldiers.  This does not look as if the King of England was abandoning the States General.  Moreover, they are sending a large embassy with handsome presents and twenty-one fine horses to accompany Count John of Nassau and other emissaries to England.  How the embassy and gifts will be received by the King time will show.

726.  England inclined for War rather than peace
              Antwerp
              March 12, 1604.
  We hear from London under date 27th ult. that the Constable of Castile asks to discuss peace with England in Flanders.  But as no conclusion about this has been reached in England he is going over there shortly.  The States General wish to hand over East and West India to England, but the English Council inclines to war rather than to peace.  Four vessels will be quite ready to start for India at the end of this month.
  Antonio Perez, too, is in England, and he will not do the cause of Spain any good with the King.  So peace is still very doubtful.
  Great preparations have been made for the entry of the King which is due to take place on the 15th unst., but whether it will do so is unknown, for last week alone there wee thirteen deaths of plague.

727.  Fresh Troops for Zeeland together with peace Overtures
              Antwerp
              March 14, 1604.
  Letters of the 5th inst. from London report that the King, in order, like the late Queen, to maintain friendship with the States General, is continuing to afford them assistance.  For this purpose he has sent 3000 soldiers to Zeeland, and some thousands more are to follow.  But he has no objection to the King of Spain raising as many troops as himself.
  Moreover, His Majesty has published a decree that all Jesuits, Seminarists and Popish priests must be gone from the country by the 20th inst. on pain of death.  Whether this will promote peace remains to be seen.  It is not known whether Parliament will meet this month.
  The Constable of Castile is making great preparations for his journey to England, and the King of Spain seems to count on peace between himself and England as a certainty.  The King of England has said too that he is no foe of Spain, and that therefore the matter is not pressing, as the only problem is the confirmation of the ancient friendship, and the Constable will be welcome whenever he comes.  But the King of England will insist that his subjects have the right to go to East India and other places outside the dominions of the King of Spain.
  Also, despite frequent requests, the King of England has not consented to give an audience to Antonio Perez, or to allow him a ship for his journey to France.  The King has had him informed that as he found people to bring him over to England without the King’s knowledge, they may as well take him back again.  So he will have to depart without an audience.
  The Dutch, who offered to hand over East and West India to the King, have received the answer that His Majesty does not desire this, that he has enough of his own, and that his only wish is to possess his countries in peace and quiet.

728.  Spanish Embassy for England
              Cologne
              March 25, 1604.
  Letters from Holland report that two Dutch ships and an English ship have taken a vessel bound from Curaçao to Portugal and shared the proceeds.  The Constable of Castile is having magnificent costumes made for his suite, in order that they may accompany him to England at the first moment possible.  He is also taking a very learned and distinguished man from Milan to be his spokesman.  He is to be accompanied by the Count von Arenberg, the President von Aerschote, and others.

729.  Still at Dunkirk
              Antwerp
              April 16, 1604.
  The Constable of Castile, who is to go to England, is still at Dunkirk, and the Count von Arenberg, who has had to stay here because of gout, may follow him any day.  There is no longer any doubt about peace with England.  However, the Spanish envoy in London is said to have asked the King there to tell him why he had expelled the ecclesiastics from his country, whereupon the King caused certain letters to be read to him describing the plot made by the clergy against the Crown of England.  But he seems to have granted the request of postponement of the date by which they had to be out of the country.  The King has also submitted the expulsion of the ecclesiastics to Parliament.

730.  James professes Indifference about the Spanish Embassy
              Rome
              April 24, 1604.
  Antonio Perez has come back to France again from England.  But they say he is not to be allowed to stay there any longer, and the yearly pension of 400 crowns granted him by the King and the guard of two Swiss are cancelled.  No doubt it was thought that he would have much influence with the King of England, but this was not the case.
  It is even said that the peace between Spain and England has fallen through owing to the conspiracy hatched by the priests.  However the Constable is supposed to be coming any day, though the King seems to have remarked that he is not impressed by the Constable’s visit nor by his compliments.
  
731.  English Raid on Algiers
              Venice
              April 30, 1604.
  Advices from Pisa say that a well-armed English ship, on board which was an envoy to the Duke of Florence, went to Algiers, and in the harbour there burnt up with fireworks eight vessels, galleys and galliots.  They thought to have caught Amurad  Reis, the owner of the vessels, but he was not on board.

732.  James and the Portuguese in India
              Antwerp
              May 14, 1604.
  The King of England has sent a nobleman to the Portuguese merchant, Simon Roderigo here, to treat about Portuguese trade to the East Indies.

733.  Peace Negotiations.  The Spaniards ask too much
              Antwerp
              July 2, 1604.
  London letters of the 10th June announce that the Spanish envoys and five of the King’s Commissioners have been meeting to discuss terms of peace.  The Spaniards began by asking what kind of peace the English required.  The English replied to this that it was the business of the Spaniards to explain themselves on the point.  The Spaniards demanded a peace offensive and defensive against the King’s enemies.  This the English refused.  Then the Spaniards asked merely for a defensive peace, whereby if one side or the other were attacked the other must come to his aid.  Thereupon the English declared that it was more to the point for them not to be at enmity with anybody than to be in need of aid from Spain, for they had no intention of breaking the peace in any direction.  Then the Spaniards asked to be informed whether the only wish of the English was that neither side should harm the other.  The Spaniards desired that the English should give no assistance to rebels against the King.  This the English took very ill, saying that it was contrary to the honour of their King.  However, this point will be further considered.

734.  Mutual Abolition of Customs Dues
              Rome
              August 14, 1604.
  Letters from France confirm the conclusion of peace between Spain and England.  The King of England does not after all cede to the Spaniards the three towns occupied in the Netherlands, but retains them for himself because the States General entrusted them to his guardianship.  The Spaniard promises the English freedom to trade in Spain, and absence of all future annoyance from the Inquisition.  The Customs dues of thirty per cent. imposed in both countries are to be abrogated on both sides.
  Notwithstanding this it is thought that the settlement of religious questions between English and Spaniards will give rise to quarrels in the future.

735.  Doubts as to the good faith of the Spaniards
              Antwerp
              August 16, 1604.
  The peace between England and Spain is not yet concluded.  The Spaniards have demanded insertion of many provisions to the detriment of the French Crown, but this has been refused them.  Many consider that it is only a formal peace that the Spaniards are trying for.  The Constable of Castile is still at Dunkirk and the English warships are still waiting for him, but he will stay there some time yet.  He wanted to purchase some jewels here through his Comptroller on three months’ credit, Francesco Sara giving security for payment.  But this latter refused to do it.  The Constable, however, can hardly go to England without these jewels, he simply must take them with him.

736.  Peace concluded but terms not yet published
              Antwerp
              September 10, 1604.
  We have letters of the 1st inst. from London stating that on the 29th ult. the conclusion of peace between Spain and England was made public.  The King gave the Constable of Castile and all the other gentlemen a very magnificent banquet, and presented them with some 100,000 carlins worth of silver plate and precious stones.  But the text of the peace is not to be printed until the King of Spain has personally sworn to observe it.  Therefore the King of England has despatched an envoy to Spain.  The Spaniards are to come back here again in a week.

737.  English Ambassador for Venice
              Venice
              September 17, 1604.
  The English ambassador who is coming to reside here to represent his King has arrived at Padua.  He will stay there till a lodging is prepared for him here.

738.  The Marseillais capture an English Vessel in the Adriatic
              Venice
              October 22, 1604.
  The Spanish ministers have sent a copy of the Anglo-Spanish treaty of peace to the Grand Turk, and it contain a provision that the King of England and other sovereigns are free to make friendship and alliance with a heretical Prince.  Therefore it is likewise permissible for the King of Spain to make friends with the Turk.
  In the gulf here an English vessel arriving with muscatel wine from Candia has been captured by the Marseilles ship Angela.

739.  The Dutch capture two English Ships
              Antwerp
              October 22, 1604.
  From England we hear that the King there has recalled all ships which the late Queen had sent out to pillage at sea.  Some of them have already come back, but the Dutch have captured and taken to Holland two English ships laden with sugar and bund for Flanders.
  The Italians here aver that the King of Spain is not content with the peace with England.

740.  Skirmish at Sea between the English and Dutch
              Cologne
              October 22, 1604.
  In Holland and Flanders there is much talk of peace, and envoys have arrived in Holland from England, Denmark and the Saxon Princes, who are strongly urging peace.  A general assembly of the States General has been called for the 18th.  They want to repay the money lent them by the Queen of England on the security of Flushing and Briel and to get rid of the garrisons there.  So peace cannot be entirely relied on.
  It is reported from Brussels that the English and Dutch ships met at sea off Zeeland.  When the English would not pay the Dutch the customary courtesy of the sea by firing a salute, the Dutch fired at them in earnest.  The others did the same, and so a regular skirmish resulted, but who won is not known at present.  On the other hand, the King of England is said to be very solicitous about Spain and His Highness, so that it seems almost as though he would like to withdraw his support from the States General.

741.  The Dutch still distrust the Spaniards
              Cologne
              October 26, 1604.
  Twenty-six Articles have been received here, proposed by the King of England for the peace between Spain and the States General.  They would not be unreasonable if they were observed by the Spaniards, but as the States General have learnt that all ships in Spain are being detained, and that the King there is fitting out an Armada against Zeeland, they are disinclined to trust to this peace, and fear that by it the trap is being baited for the mouse.

742.  Articles of Peace
            unknown
            Undated
  Articles of the peace concluded between the Kings of England and Spain and to be observed by their subjects throughout the realm.
  1.  The loyal subjects of the King are to observe all articles of the peace just as in
    former times.

  14.  The subjects of the King shall elect a Council and deputies to examine all

    sent back to England with their property.
  20.  Offences of Englishmen against religion are to be reported to England.
  21.  The subjects of the King of England shall not proceed to places in the West
    Indies outside the dominions of the King of Spain.

743.  Rejoicings at Antwerp
              Antwerp
              November 5, 1604.
  The peace with England was made public last Sunday, and then at nine o’clock in the evening all sorts of bonfires were lighted, feux de joie let off, and a great peace celebration was held with drums and fifes and discharge of cannon.

744.  Spanish Attempt to separate France and the States General
              Lyons
              November 21, 1604.
  The latest letters from England announce that by order of the King of England the Constable of Castile is to persuade our King to give no further assistance to the States General in order that the King of Spain may at length be able to attain peace with them.  But it is not thought that the King of France will assent.  The Constable of Castile has already left Fontainebleau again.

745.  Debates about the Union of England and Scotland
              Antwerp
              December 3, 1604.
  The latest letters from London announce that the Parliament and other important people are annoyed that the King has had himself proclaimed King of Great Britain without their previous knowledge.  But owing to this desire of His Majesty it is debated daily how the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland can be united under one title.
  In Scotland a rebellion seems to have occurred because the King of England has made peace with the King of Spain.  The King of Scots’ guard is said to have been slaughtered, and so His Majesty has a rebellion in his own country.
  The English envoys have not yet appeared in Brussels, but are expected shortly.  In the meanwhile Hollanders and Zeelanders incessantly attack and take English ships bound for Flanders and Spain, and carry off all captured cargo as their own property.

746.  The Low Countries still disinclined for Peace
              Antwerp
              December 10, 1604.
  All we hear from Brussels is that His Highness there is expecting an important embassy from the King of England.  His Highness has had some very handsome objects made of solid gold for presentation to the English envoys, as the King of England presented equally handsome gifts to the embassy of His Serene Highness.
  There is little talk of peace in Brussels.  The States General of the United Provinces desire to send Count Henry William of Nassau, youngest brother of Count Maurice, as ambassador to the King of England to treat for an alliance.

747.  The Peace has done little good to any one
              Antwerp
              December 12, 1604.
  His Highness in Brussels does not expect that English Embassy till March.  Instead of the gold dinner service which His Highness had intended to give, he is now having five cups and jugs made of solid gold valued at 50,000 carlins, to send to England as presents for the English gentlemen who helped to negotiate peace.  But this peace has so far done little good to trade or anything else.

748.  Turkish Maltreatment of English at Alexandria
              Venice
              December 24, 1604.
  It is confirmed that the Turks in Alexandria have been grossly maltreating the English, and it is therefore asserted that the King of England ill take steps against the Turks.
